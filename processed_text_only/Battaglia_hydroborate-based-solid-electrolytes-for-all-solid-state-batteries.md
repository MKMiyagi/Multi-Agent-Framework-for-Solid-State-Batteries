Hydroborates , i . e . ionic salts of boron -hydrogen compounds , are an emerging material class of solid electrolytes for all -solid -state batteries . In particular , some of the metal hydroborates (≠ neutral hydroboranes ) featuring three -dimensional anion clusters exhibit exceptional thermal and ( electro ) chemical stability , and liquid -like ionic conductivity with a unique ion conduction mechanism . These characteristics enable the fabrication of competitive all -solid -state cells with stable battery cycling performance . This chapter reviews the attractive material properties of hydroborates and their implementation as highly conductive solid electrolytes in all -solid -state batteries .

## 1 . Introduction

Boron ( B ) is the smallest atom in Group 13 of the periodic table with the atomic number of 5 and has three valence electrons , one less than the neighboring carbon ( C ). B-B or B-H bonds in a molecule are often analogized to C-C or C-H covalent bonds , which represent localized two -center two -electron ( 2c2e ) bonds . The one -electron deficiency in a B atom also creates multi -center bonds and accounts for peculiar and intriguing properties of boron -hydrogen compounds , enabling the formation of stable three -dimensional clusters that can function as solid ionic conductors for all -solid -state batteries .

Multi -center boron bonds , e . g . three -center two -electron ( 3c2e ) B-B-Bbonds , are represented in Figure 1 , where three atomic orbitals form one filled bonding molecular orbital and two empty antibonding molecular orbitals . This type of a 3c2e bond was initially proposed by Eberhardt et al . ( 2 ) for boron -hydrogen compounds , i . e . the two B-H-B bridging -bond configuration to explain the stability of diborane B 2 H 6 , which is the simple substitution of C with B in C 2 H 6 but with two electrons less . Such multi -center bonding is a key structural characteristic of polyhedra and polyhedral fragments of ' electron -deficient ' ( compared to carbon compounds ) boron cluster

compounds , e . g . neutral hydroboranes and negatively charged hydroborate anions , featured by so -called Wade-Mingos rules ( 3 , 4 ).

As summarized in Figure 2 , cage -like closo n -vertex polyhedra and their structural fragments , nido ( n -1 )-vertex polyhedra and arachno ( n -2 )-vertex polyhedra , have the common number ( n + 1 ) of skeletal bonding molecular orbitals and of skeletal electron pairs , and hence 2 n + 2 skeletal electrons ( 5 , 6 ). In other words , whenthenumberofcluster vertices n is kept constant , the number of skeletal orbitals and of skeletal electron pairs for closo ([ B n H n ] 2 - ), nido ( B n H n + 4 or [ B n H n + 3 ] - ), and arachno ( B n H n + 6 ) clusters are n + 1 , n + 2 , and n + 3 , respectively . Mingos extended Wade ' s electron counting rule to the total number of electrons ( i . e . 4 n + 2 for closo , 4 n + 4 for nido , and 4 n + 6 for arachno ) by including 2 n exo -electrons corresponding to the B-H bonds ( 7 , 8 ). The delocalized 3c2e skeletal bonding and globally delocalized states contribute to three -dimensional aromaticity , resulting in exceptional structural stability in a series of bulky hydroborate clusters ( 1 , 9 , 10 ). For instance , an icosahedral hydroborate [ B12 H 12 ] 2 - , together with the isoelectronic monocarbaborate [ CB11 H 12 ] -and neutral dicarbaborane C 2 B 10 H 12 , show unusual chemical and thermal stability , and low toxicity ( 11 -13 ).

Due to their high stability , low toxicity , functionalizability , etc ., metal hydroborates and heteroborates have been studied in many different fields of applications such as medicine ( 14 -17 ), hydrogen storage ( 18 -20 ), luminescence ( 21 ), catalysis ( 22 , 23 ), and polymers ( 24 ). Currently , one of the potentially most impactful applications among them is as solid electrolytes for all -solid -state batteries as the ongoing electrification of the mobility sector motivate research on next -generation rechargeable batteries with higher energy density and faster charging/discharging than current -generation Li -ion batteries ( 25 -28 ). Details of the research history , synthesis , and crystal chemistry of metal hydroborates are summarized in the previous perspective papers ( 13 , 18 , 20 , 29 -33 ). Section 2 reviews the recent development of hydroborate solid electrolytes and their implementation into all -solid -state batteries .

Furthermore , Section 3 features recent computational studies on material properties of hydroborates that need to be considered for solid electrolyte applications , e . g . ion conduction mechanism , electrochemical stability , and mechanical properties . This review offers a comprehensive overview of the practical applications of hydroborates to solid electrolytes in the ever -expanding field of all -solid -state batteries .

## 2 . Metal Hydroborates as Solid Electrolytes

## 2 . 1 . Discovery of Superionic Conductors

Metal hydroborates are comprised of cations ( e . g . alkali metal and alkaline earth metal ) and three -dimensional cluster anions with boron -hydrogen and boron -boron covalent bonds . Structures

of the representative hydroborate cluster anions are listed in Figure 3 . Hydroborate solid electrolytes draw growing attention because they combine material properties suitable for the implementation in all -solid -state batteries , including compatibility with Li and/or Na metal anodes , low gravimetric density (&lt; 1 . 2 g cm -3 ; less than half of other material classes ), soft mechanical properties enabling cold pressing , high thermal and chemical stability , solution processability , and low toxicity ( 13 , 32 ).

White and black balls represent hydrogen ( H ) and carbon ( C ) atoms , respectively . The others represent boron ( B ) atoms .

Complex hydrides have been originally studied as hydrogen storage materials , among which LiBH 4 was first discovered to exhibit order-disorder phase transition upon microwave irradiation ( 34 , 35 ). Matsuo et al . found superionic conduction (&gt; 10 -3 S cm -1 ) in its hexagonal high -temperature phase above the phase -transition temperature of &gt; 115 ° C with an activation energy of 0 . 53 eV ( 36 ), initiating a research field on hydroborates as solid ionic conductors . Also , larger cage -like closo -hydroborate anions [ B n H n ] 2 - ( n = 10 , 12 ) are found to show order-disorder phase transition ( 37 , 38 ). In particular , the disordered phases of Na 2 B 10 H 10 and Na 2 B 12 H 12 above their respective phase -transition temperatures exhibit around one order -of -magnitude higher ionic conductivity than that of LiBH 4 ( 39 , 40 ). Furthermore , both Li and Na salts of open -cage nido -hydroborate [ B11 H 14 ] -or closo -monocarbaborate [ CB n -1 H n ] - ( n = 10 , 12 ) anions , which removes or substitutes one boron ( B ) atom of closo -hydroborates by a carbon ( C ) atom , respectively , possess even higher ionic conductivity in their high -temperature phases ( 41 -45 ). Although the ideal cation -to -anion size ratio for fast ionic conduction may vary with different cation radii ( 33 , 45 ), the general trend of conductivity enhancement in monovalent nido -hydroborates and closo -monocarbaborates originates partly from their lower anion charge , reducing the electrostatic interactions with cations compared to divalent closo -hydroborates ( 46 ). Figure 4 summarizes the temperature -dependent ionic conductivity of representative hydroborate solid electrolytes .

Figure 4 . ( a ) Temperature -dependent Li + conductivity of Li hydroborates ( 36 , 41 , 42 , 45 , 47-51 ). ( b ) Temperature -dependent Na + conductivity of Na hydroborates ( 39-44 , 52-59 ).

Order-disorder phase transitions of hydroborates are confirmed experimentally by ion dynamics studies ( 46 , 55 , 60 -70 ). The easiest observable is the line width of NMR spectra . When hydrogen ( H ) atoms are involved in thermally activated jump motions , the line width of 1 HNMR Δ H at low temperatures ( typically 10 4 -10 5 s -1 ) starts to decrease with increasing temperatures and hence the H jump rates τ -1 from when τ -1 ≈ Δ H . This is because long -range translational diffusion averages out static dipole-dipole interactions of 1 Hspins in a rigid lattice , leading to very small Δ H values at high temperatures , i . e . τ -1 ≫ Δ H . In the case of hydroborates with localized motions ( such as anion reorientations ), however , the line -width narrowing (= decrease in Δ H ) due to the averaging occurs only partially ( 63 , 65 , 71 ). At elevated temperatures ( τ -1 ≫ Δ H ), ' intramolecular ' dipole-dipole interactions within the same anion are averaged out , while ' intermolecular ' interactions between nuclear spins from different anions remain partially . Thus , Δ H converges to a certain finite value , unlike the case only with long -range translational diffusion . Therefore , the temperature dependence of the line -width narrowing can be used as a qualitative indicator of the presence of localized anion motions in hydroborates .

The atomic jump rates τ -1 of anion reorientational motions can be further characterized by measuring the nuclear spin -lattice relaxation rates R 1 at around μ s -to ns -timescale ( 46 , 55 , 60 -70 ). R 1 reaches the maximum ( e . g . R 1 H peaks shown in Figure 5 ) when τ -1 is nearly equal to the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency ω ( in MHz ), i . e . ωτ ≈ 1 . In the limit of slow atomic motion ( ωτ ≫ 1 ), R 1 is proportional to ω -2 τ -1 , whereas , in the limit of fast motion ( ωτ ≪ 1 ), R 1 is proportional to τ and becomes frequency independent ( see R 1 H above phase -transition temperatures in Figure 5 ). Such proportional relationships in each limit region enable a direct correlation of R 1 with τ -1 . Furthermore , assuming that the temperature dependence of the jump rates τ -1 follows the Arrhenius law , the activation energy E a can be quantified in both limit regions .

Upon the phase transition of hydroborates , the 1 H spin -lattice relaxation rate R 1 H ( e . g . Na 2 B 12 H12 and NaCB 11 H 12 shown in Figure 5 ) drops discontinuously by a few orders of magnitude ( 63 , 65 , 71 ). This corresponds to a soar in the anion reorientational jump rate τ -1 , exhibiting dramatic acceleration of the reorientational motion of the hydroborate anions . Such an acceleration is accompanied by an abrupt change in the 23 Na spin -lattice relaxation rate R 1 Na from slow -to fast -motion regions with a decrease in the activation energy , indicating the acceleration of translational , long -range cation diffusion induced by fast anion reorientations .

These phenomena are also evidenced by quasi -elastic neutron scattering ( QENS ) experiments that probe microscopic relaxation processes at a much shorter ps -timescale ( 55 , 61 , 62 , 64 , 66 , 67 , 70 , 72 , 73 ) The drop in the elastic neutron scattering intensity at the phase -transition temperature indicates that anion reorientational jump rates (= frequencies ) increase by a few orders of magnitude from &lt; 10 7 s -1 to &gt; 10 10 s -1 . The ratio of elastic to total (= elastic + quasi -elastic ) scattering intensities , i . e . so -called elastic incoherent structure factor ( EISF ), suggests that the anion reorientation mechanism shifts from a uniaxial to a multiaxial character above the phase -transition temperature . Although NMR and QENS measurements characterize rather a microscopic relaxation at a short timescale , these findings are in line with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at a relatively longer timescale ( from MHz to Hz or mHz ). In other words , fast anion reorientations in the disordered , high -temperature phases induce the dramatic enhancement of cation conduction , resulting in a leap in ionic conductivity upon order-disorder phase transition ( see Figure 4 ). The phase -transition temperatures vary with the combination of cation and hydroborate anion species , but the conductivity jump upon phase transition is a commonly observed feature of hydroborate solid electrolytes ( 64 ). Complementary computational studies on the ion conduction mechanism of hydroborate solid electrolytes will be discussed in Section 3 .

Toobtain high room -temperature ionic conductivity , manyattempts have been made to stabilize the disordered , high -temperature phases of hydroborates . Reducing the crystallite size and possibly introducing H -atom deficiencies by ball milling are shown to increase ionic conductivity ( 74 , 75 ); however , this approach produces metastable compounds that can be vulnerable to the re -formation of low -temperature phases after thermal cycling . Nano -confinement in nanoporous hosts is also found to be effective for the conductivity improvement of e . g . LiBH 4 and Li 4 ( BH4 ) 3 I due to the suppression of a long -range order at the nm -scale thin layer of hydroborates on the pore walls ( 63 , 76 -79 ). However , the room -temperature Li + or Na + conductivity of nano -confined hydroborates has yet to exceed 10 -3 S cm -1 ( 70 , 76 -86 ). Chemical modifications , e . g . partial or full halogenation , of hydroborate anions are also investigated , which so far result in an undesirable increase in phase -transition temperatures ( 87 -89 ), apart from the iodination of M 2 B 12 H 12 ( M = Li , Na ) ( 90 , 91 ). Alternatively , cation mixing shows a moderate improvement of ionic conductivity but raises the question of which cation in which fraction is conducted in the electrolytes due to the presence of multiple charge -carrier species ( 92 -95 ).

So far , anion mixing by ball milling and/or heat treatment is the most successful approach to the high -temperature phase stabilization of hydroborates ( see Figure 4 ). This was first attempted to stabilize the high -temperature phase of LiBH 4 with halides Li X ( X = Cl , Br , I ) ( 48 , 96 ). Among the anion mixtures , Li 4 ( BH4 ) 3 I exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of &gt; 10 -4 S cm -1 at room temperature due to cell volume expansion by relatively large and polarizable I -ions ( 48 , 96 ). Slightly higher room -temperature conductivity is also obtained by mixing LiBH 4 with LiNH 2 or P 2 S 5 ( 49 , 51 , 97 ). For Na analogs , a mixed anion Na 2 ( BH4 )( NH2 ) exhibits improved room -temperature conductivity of 3 × 10 -6 S cm -1 , which is by four orders of magnitude higher than that of NaBH 4 ( 56 , 57 , 69 ). Additionally , ternary anion mixing in [ BH4 ] - -based systems recently shows conductivity improvement ( 98 , 99 ).

The approach of binary anion systems was further extended to mixing two hydroborate anion species ( see Figure 4 ); for example , Na 3 ( BH4 )( B12 H 12 ) show the highest NaBH 4 -based room -temperature conductivity of 5 × 10 -4 S cm -1 ( 59 ). Mixing two types of closo -hydroborates and/ or monocarbaborates is even more effective due to the higher conductivity of their original high -temperature phases than [ BH4 ] - . In particular , mixed closo -hydroborate anions are extensively studied and found to be Na + superionic conductors (&gt; 10 -3 S cm -1 ) at room temperature , e . g . Na 4 ( B12 H 12 )( B10 H 10 ) and Na 4 ( CB11 H 12 ) 2 ( B12 H 12 ) that crystallize in the disordered , high -temperature phases of [ B10 H 10 ] 2 -and [ B12 H 12 ] 2 - , respectively ( 32 , 100 -102 ). Some of the closo -hydroborate anion mixtures can also be obtained by the reaction products from [ BH4 ] -salts and neutral decaborane B10 H 14 ( 103 , 104 ). Recent studies show that anion mixtures of closo -hydroborates or monocarbaborates with an open -cage nido -hydroborate [ B11 H 14 ] -stabilize a disordered phase and also exhibit high room -temperature ionic conductivity (&gt; 10 -3 S cm -1 ) respectively ( 43 -45 , 67 , 105 ). In principle , Na closo -hydroborates and monocarbaborates tend to exhibit roughly one -order -of -magnitude higher conductivity upon anion mixing than Li counterparts ( 32 , 103 , 106 ), which can be attributed to the high polarizability and large ionic radius

of Na + ions that are beneficial to cation conduction in the framework of the mixed closo -hydroborate anions .

Among these hydroborate anion mixtures , a combination of [ 1 -CB9 H 10 ] -and [ CB11 H 12 ] -is shown to record the highest room -temperature conductivity with low activation energies in both Li and Na systems , i . e . Li ( CB9 H 10 ) 0 . 7 ( CB11 H 12 ) 0 . 3 (= 0 . 7Li ( CB9 H 10 ) -0 . 3Li ( CB11 H 12 )) with 7 × 10 -3 S cm -1 and 0 . 28 eV , and Na 2 ( CB9 H 10 )( CB11 H 12 ) with 7 × 10 -2 S cm -1 and 0 . 23 eV , respectively ( see Figure 4 ) ( 47 , 55 , 106 ). Notably , the latter marks the highest room -temperature ionic conductivity among ever -reported Na + solid electrolytes , followed by Na 2 . 9 Sb 0 . 9 W 0 . 1 S 4 with 4 × 10 -2 Scm -1 ( 107 , 108 ). It is worth mentioning that some of the mixed closo -or nido -hydroborate anions experience no distinct phase transition but exhibit non -Arrhenius conductivity behaviors with significant changes in activation energies between ≥ 0 . 60 eV and &lt; 0 . 35 eV , including glass -like transition and correlated ion motion ( 32 , 44 , 55 , 72 ). These behaviors with higher activation energies are observed at relatively low temperatures where thermal energy is not sufficient to saturate ( i ) the background energy fluctuation , which can be attributed to short -range cation-cation and cation-anion correlation , and ( ii ) anisotropic anion reorientations around specific symmetry axes of the two constituent anions .

In terms of material preparation processes , the closo -hydroborate mixture Na 4 ( B12 H 12 )( B10 H 10 ) can be prepared by crystallization out of an equimolar solution of Na 2 B 12 H12 and Na 2 B 10 H 10 using a suitable solvent as well as by ball milling ( and subsequent heat treatment ). Facile wet -chemical synthesis of [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -and [ CB11 H 12 ] -salts and Na 4 ( B12 H 12 )( B10 H 10 ) is also reported with a cost -competitive reagent NaBH 4 via [ B11 H 14 ] - , which leaves the potential for future upscaling and mass production ( 44 , 109 -115 ).

The quest for hydroborate solid electrolytes is further extended to other charge -carrier ions . Compared to Li + and Na + analogs , KCB11 H 12 exhibits a lower phase -transition temperature but lower conductivity in both low -and high -temperature phases , which is explained as the steric hindrance of K + translational diffusion due to the large cation size ( 66 ). In contrast , NMR studies of KBH 4 and M 2 B 12 H 12 ( M = K , Rb , Cs ) show no phase transition up to 300 ° C and decreasing activation energies of reorientational anion motions with increasing cation radius ( and lattice parameters ) ( 65 , 68 , 116 , 117 ). This indicates that hydroborates with larger cation sizes ( i . e . Rb + , Cs + ) than K + may contribute to facilitating cation diffusion again due to the expansion of the disordered lattice ( 118 ).

For alkaline earth metal cations , Mg hydroborate solid electrolytes , e . g . mixed anions with [ BH4 ] - , generally hold relatively low room -temperature ionic conductivity ( up to 10 -5 S cm -1 ) and the difficulty to remove solvents due to strong Coulombic interaction with divalent Mg 2 + ions ( 31 , 119 , 120 ). This limits the use of closo compounds , e . g . Mg ( CB11 H 12 ) 2 to ion -conducting salts for organic liquid electrolytes or ionic liquids ( 121 -123 ).

## 2 . 2 . Implementation in All -Solid -State Batteries

Hydroborates already exhibit sufficiently high ionic conductivity to be implemented into stably working all -solid -state batteries . In parallel to the first discovery of superionic conduction in LiBH 4 ,

the implementation into a first all -solid -state battery was initiated with LiBH 4 -based solid electrolytes ( 124 ). For anode and cathode active materials , Li metal and TiS 2 are typically employed , respectively , as was the case with the prototype cells of lithium -ion batteries ( 125 ). One clear distinction from lithium -ion batteries is that hydroborate -based all -solid -state batteries promise a more realistic use of alkali metal anodes as some of the hydroborate solid electrolytes are shown to be kinetically or thermodynamically stable in contact with alkali metal ( e . g . Li or Na metal ) ( 126 , 127 ). For instance , LiBH 4 shows stable 100 h galvanostatic stripping/plating in a symmetric cell with Li metal at 0 . 2 mA cm -2 and 0 . 1 mAh cm -2 at 120 ° C , which is above the phase -transition temperature of LiBH 4 ( 126 ). Also , alkali metal anodes function as a reservoir of charge -carrier cations , enabling the use of e . g . ' Li -free ' cathode active materials .

Taking these advantages , stable battery cycling in TiS 2 | LiBH 4 | Li cells was obtained with a capacity retention of &gt; 85 % after 300 cycles at C/5 at 120 ° C ( 128 ). The operating temperature can be reduced by anion mixing e . g . Li 4 ( BH4 ) 3 X ( X = Cl , Br , I ) and Li 3 ( BH4 )( NH2 ) 2 ( 49 , 97 , 99 , 129 -131 ) or by nano -confinement ( 77 , 80 ). Although the electrochemical oxidative stability of LiBH 4 was initially claimed to be &gt; 5 V vs . Li + /Li , bulk -type all -solid -state cells with a LiBH 4 solid electrolyte exhibit large irreversible capacity , impedance growth , and quick capacity fading with a Li 3PO4 -coated LiCoO 2 cathode ( 124 , 132 ). Its oxidative stability was recently revealed to be up to ~2 V vs . Li + /Li by linear sweep voltammetry ( 133 ).

This instability of LiBH 4 at high electrochemical potentials directed research to employ a secondary non -hydroborate solid electrolyte ( 77 , 130 , 134 ) or electrode active materials with relatively low redox potentials (≤ 2 . 7Vvs . Li + /Li ) like TiS 2 . Examples of the latter are Li 4 Ti 5 O12 ( 49 , 135 ) or alternatively elemental sulfur ( S ) to gain more capacity as compensation for low cell voltages ( 1672 mAh g -1 for S vs 239 mAh g -1 for TiS 2 ) ( 79 , 126 , 136 -138 ). However , the low electronic conductivity of sulfur requires a large fraction of conductive carbon in the electrode composite , reducing its specific energy and energy density significantly . The large volume changes upon ( de ) lithiation of sulfur cause significant capacity fading in the first few cycles in S | LiBH 4 | Li and S | Li 4 ( BH4 ) 3 I | Li cells ( 77 , 79 , 136 , 138 ). This is accompanied by constant electrolyte decomposition during long -term cycling as the operating voltage range still goes beyond the oxidative stability limit ( ~2 V vs . Li + /Li ) of the electrolyte .

A similar approach was employed for preliminary studies on the implementation of closo -hydroborate and monocarbaborate solid electrolytes into all -solid -state batteries . They also show compatibility with Li metal , and all -solid -state cells were tested with a TiS 2 cathode for a relatively short term (≤ 20 cycles ) ( 42 , 50 , 75 , 140 ). Among them , the best electrochemical performance was obtained with Li ( CB9 H 10 ) 0 . 7 ( CB11 H 12 ) 0 . 3 ( see Figure 6 ), which exhibits no overpotential increase and Li dendrite formation during 300 h galvanostatic stripping/plating in a Li symmetric cell at 0 . 2 mA cm -2 and 0 . 1 mAh cm -2 at 25 ° C ( 47 ). The high ionic conductivity of this electrolyte and its tolerance at high current densities lead to high rate capability , e . g . &gt; 70 % capacity remaining at high C -rates compared to low C -rates , i . e . at 10C vs C/10 with a TiS 2 cathode and at 1C vs 0 . 03C with a sulfur cathode , respectively ( 47 , 141 ). At an elevated temperature of 60 ° C , the TiS 2 cathode exhibits ~70 % capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1C charging/discharging . Onthe other hand , the sulfur cathode involves a large capacity fading in the first cycle . But compared to the second cycle , the

reversible capacity retains ~70 % after 100 cycles at 60 ° Cat 1C charging and 5C discharging , which corresponds to a current density of ~4 mA cm -2 . The operating potential range in these experiments lies within the electrochemical oxidative stability of the mixed -anion closo -monocarbaborates ( ~3 . 4 V vs . Li + /Li ) ( 133 ).

For Na hydroborates , the implementation into all -solid -state batteries started relatively recently using closo -hydroborates ; nevertheless , stable cycling with a higher cell voltage is achieved than for Li hydroborates ( see Figure 6 ). Duchêne et al . employed Na 4 ( B12 H 12 )( B10 H 10 ) in a Na symmetric cell , demonstrating no Na dendrite formation during &gt; 280 h galvanostatic stripping/plating at 0 . 1 mA cm -2 and 1 . 2 mAh cm -2 at 60 ° C ( 52 ). The compatibility of this electrolyte with Na metal is also indicated by X -ray tomography ( 142 ). Electrochemical stability experiments also indicate the possibility of battery cycling up to ~3 V vs Na + /Na ( 52 , 133 ), which matches the redox potential of NaCrO 2 with a theoretical capacity of 120 mAh g -1 . Moreover , the solution processability of this electrolyte enables dramatic improvement of the electrode/electrolyte contact by electrolyte coating without sacrificing ionic conductivity . Such intimate contact , as well as moderate electronic conductivity and minimal volume changes (&lt; 0 . 3 %) of NaCrO 2 , achieves 85 % capacity retention after 250 cycles at C/5 in NaCrO 2 | Na 4 ( B12 H 12 )( B10 H 10 )| Na cells at 60 ° C ( 139 ). The solution -based process is further applied to infiltrate the electrolyte into slurry -casted porous electrodes . This solution infiltration , the use of a Na -Sn anode , and applied external pressure ( 3 MPa and 70 MPa ) enable 67 % capacity remaining at 5C charging/discharging ( compared to C/10 ) of NaCrO 2 at 30 ° C with a high mass loading of 7 . 7 mg cm -2 , corresponding to a current density of 4 . 5 mA cm -2 ( 143 ).

A similar study was also done for Na 4 ( CB11 H 12 ) 2 ( B12 H 12 ), which reports stable galvanostatic Na stripping/plating for 500 h at 25 . 5 μ A cm -2 and 12 . 8 μ Ah cm -2 at room temperature and preliminary cycling experiments with NaCrO2 ( 144 ). This mixed -anion hydroborate solid electrolyte further exhibits the first hydroborate -based 4 V all -solid -state battery cycling at room temperature with an excellent capacity ( 78 %) and energy ( 76 %) retention after 800 cycles at C/ 5 in Na 3 ( VOPO4 ) 2 F | Na 4 ( CB11 H 12 ) 2 ( B12 H 12 )| Na cells ( see Figure 7 ) ( 54 ). This was enabled by introducing a conceptually novel interface passivation functionality of mixed -anion hydroborates , in which the electrochemically more stable hydroborate anions ([ CB11 H 12 ] -up to 4 . 2 V vs . Na + /Nain this case ) remain intact and serve as an ion -conducting interphase when the less stable hydroborate anions ([ B12 H 12 ] 2 -up to 3 . 4 V vs . Na + /Na in this case ) partially decompose at high potentials . The cell marks the highest average discharge cell voltage ( that is comparable to the Li counterparts ) and specific energy based on insertion -type cathode active materials among all -solid -state Na batteries reported so far , which emphasizes the potential of hydroborate solid electrolytes for a competitive all -solid -state battery technology .

## 3 . Material Properties of Hydroborate Solid Electrolytes

## 3 . 1 . Ion Conduction Mechanism of Hydroborates

As seen in the previous section , metal hydroborates , particularly closo -hydroborates including C -substituted derivatives , are regarded as promising solid electrolytes with liquid -like Li + and Na + conductivity (&gt; 10 -3 S cm -1 ) and the capability to fabricate stably working all -solid -state batteries . Among their attractive material properties , the characteristics of superionic conduction of closo -hydroborates and their ion conduction mechanism are discussed first .

The ionic conductivity σ of a solid is generally described by an activated hopping process of a charge -carrier ion from an occupied lattice site to a neighboring empty lattice site ( 145 ). Although the energy trajectory varies with migration pathways , the energy barrier of hopping in a given migration direction is governed by the Gibbs free energy of the hopping process Δ G , which is deconvoluted into the migration enthalpy (≈ the activation energy E a in superionic conductors ) ( 146 ) and the migration entropy Δ S m . Therefore , the conductivity σ can be written as :

In conventional hopping theory ( 147 ), the prefactor σ 0 is

with a geometric factor z ( including diffusion anisotropies and correlation factors ; z ≤ 1 ), the density of charge carrier ions n , the charge of the ions Ze , the jump distance a 0 , the Boltzmann constant k B , and the jump frequency ν 0 , which is the product of the attempt frequency and the jump probability ( 148 ). According to these functions , favorable crystal structures for fast ion conduction typically contain ( i ) a large number of available crystallographic sites with high charge carrier density n , ( ii ) low activation barrier E a for jumps between adjacent sites , ( iii ) similar potential energies at the initial and final state of the jump to increase the probability ( and hence the frequency ) of both forward and backward jumps with no specific preferences . For example , sulfide solid electrolytes with a body -centered cubic ( bcc ) structure are shown to have symmetric migration pathways with the lowest energy barrier through face -sharing tetrahedral -tetrahedral site hopping , as exemplified in Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 ( see Figure 8 ) ( 149 ).

Toimproveionic conductivity , increasing the content of charge carriers by altering compositions is beneficial for a larger prefactor σ 0 . Alternatively , lowering the activation barriers E a e . g . by multi -ion concerted migration is also effective to broaden the diffusion pathways and thereby open up the structural bottlenecks for ion jumps in the crystal structure ( 145 , 150 ). However , this is not always the case e . g . in Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 when the isotropy of three -dimensional diffusion pathways is diminished by increasing the unit cell volume ( 151 ). Moreover , increasing the polarizability of the anion framework (= ' softening ' a lattice ) is proposed to lower the Debye frequencies , which correspond to a vibration mode across the saddle point of the migration energy landscape , and hence reduces the activation barrier ( 149 , 151 , 152 ). However , a ' softer ' lattice also lowers the prefactor σ 0 by decreasing the migration entropy Δ S m ( influenced by nearly all vibrational frequencies around the migration pathway ), the attempt frequency , and hence the jump frequency ν 0 . This dilemma shows a trade -off between the prefactor σ 0 and activation energy E a for higher ionic conductivity σ to design the structure of superionic conductors ( 145 ). Analternative approach is to introduce distorted interstitial sites to flatten the energy landscape of cation migration , which is shown to achieve both a high pre -factor and low activation energy in LiTi 2 ( PS 4 ) 3 ( 153 ).

In contrast , the ion conduction in closo -hydroborates works differently from that in sulfide and oxide solid electrolytes . First of all , superionic conduction in closo -hydroborates is normally achieved by an order-disorder phase transition ; and the disordered , high -temperature phases can be stabilized at room temperature by hydroborate anion mixing ( 47 , 55 , 74 , 100 , 102 ). Unlike highly conductive sulfides ( 149 ), most of the high -temperature phases form a face -centered cubic ( fcc ) or hexagonal close -packed ( hcp ) structure , except a bcc structure of Na 2 B 12 H12 and Na -1 -CB9 H 10 ( 33 ). Furthermore , decreasing the charge -carrier concentration by substitution of one B atom by C increases the ionic conductivity and reduces the phase -transition temperature ( 41 , 42 ), which does not fit the classical hopping model . To explain the fundamental difference in the ion conduction mechanism , Kweon et al . proposed a combination of three types of frustrations based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations ( see Figure 9 ) ( 46 , 154 -157 ).

Figure 9 . Effects of structural , chemical , and dynamical frustration on the potential energy landscape . Reproduced with permission from reference ( 155 ) . Copyright ( 2017 ) American Chemical Society .

The first factor is structural frustration derived from lattice site preferences ( 155 ). Since metal hydroborates are ionic salts , the preferred coordination environment and interstitial sites of cations can be predicted by the cation -to -anion radius ratio , according to the first Pauling rule with a hard -sphere , close -packed approximation ( 33 , 158 ). This parameter basically governs the anion lattice structure , types , and probability of interstitial sites for cations and vacancies , which constructs the basic energy landscape of migration pathways with local minima at each interstitial site . Vacancies are formed by an intrinsic mismatch between stoichiometry and preferred interstitial sites . The cation conduction is aided by the availability (= density ) and accessibility of interstitial sites at sufficiently low local minima ; i . e . less preferred interstitial sites and cation ordering can naturally flatten the overall energy landscape . In particular , the high density of tetrahedral sites , e . g . in the bcc structure shown in Li 10 GeP 2 S 12 ( 149 ), combined with high vacancy concentrations to tolerate disordering , is likely to be beneficial for ion conduction in Li and Na closo -hydroborates . However , as mentioned above , the structure factor cannot solely account for exceptional ionic conductivity in the fcc or hcp structure .

The second factor is chemical frustration between the local anion geometry and crystal lattice symmetry ( 155 ). In the case of [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -anions and Li + or Na + cations , cations tend to be bound above the triad center of B atoms by short -range cation -anion interactions , which creates a preferred cation distribution based on the icosahedral symmetry of the [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -anions . This

cation distribution is incompatible with the preferred symmetry of the occupied lattice interstitial sites . This incompatibility and hence intrinsic frustration create additional local minima in the energy landscape , thereby facilitating cation migration . For example , trigonal and linear site distributions in the fcc lattice of Li 2 B 12 H 12 are incompatible with the possible anion orientations , inducing symmetry frustration compared to the bcc lattice . This type of frustration is also observed in halide solid electrolytes ( 159 ).

The last factor is dynamic frustration caused by anion rotation ( 155 ). As the frequency range of vibrational , librational , and rotational (= reorientational ) modes of anions overlap significantly with the frequency range of cation -derived modes , the cations docked to anions can be carried and subsequently released by the rotation of hydroborate anions . This anion rotation dynamically alters the nature of the above -mentioned symmetry incompatibility and fluctuates the underlying potential energy landscape , which enhances long -range diffusion and local mobility of cations . This type of frustration is prominent after the transition to the disordered phase , as reported by Lu and Ciucci , and Sau et al . ( 160 -162 ) Advanced molecular dynamics simulations show that the phase transition causes significantly high anion reorientational motion as well as lattice parameter expansion . As shown in Figure 10 , the reorientation of anions distributes cations to other interstitial sites with relatively low occupancy , creates well -connected cation diffusion pathways , and lowers the energy barrier for cation hopping . In the case of the fcc structure such as Li 2 B 12 H12 and Na 2 B 10 H 10 , the occupancy difference between tetrahedral and octahedral sites becomes smaller upon the phase transition with cell volume expansion of the unchanged crystal structure , facilitating tetrahedral -octahedral -tetrahedral site hoping ( 160 -162 ). These observations fit well with the acceleration of anion reorientational jump rates and cation diffusion upon order-disorder phase transitions of hydroborates shown in dynamical studies ( 64 , 65 , 73 ).

This concept can be extended to account for the enhanced ionic conduction and lower phase -transition temperature of closo -monocarbaborates , i . e . C -substituted closo -hydroborates ( 46 , 162 ). In the case of LiCB 11 H 12 , the anion lattice forms the fcc symmetry . The more positive exo -Hatom in the C-H bond than in other B-H bonds induces a stronger local repulsion to a cation , locating the cations to the farthest triad from the C atom in the cage anion . This preferred orientation by local anion-cation Coulomb interaction introduces frustration between the lattice symmetry and the internal symmetry of the anion . Moreover , the asymmetry in anions generated by the stronger repulsion produces a higher degree of disorder in the system , reducing anion reorientational barrier and the corresponding phase -transition temperature ( 127 , 162 ). The asymmetric [ CB11 H 12 ] -anions also increase the effective anion radius by rotation , which enhances cell volume expansion uponphase transition , in contrast to symmetric [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -anions ( 162 ). In addition , the half cation occupancy in [ CB11 H 12 ] -and [ 1 -CB9 H 10 ] -compared to in [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -and [ B10 H 10 ] 2 -produces morevacancies and more uniform cation distributions to tetrahedral and octahedral sites with almost no cation-cation correlation . These contribute to facilitated anion reorientational motion in the disordered phases of closo -monocarbaborates , according to dynamical studies ( 46 , 64 ). Although the effects of monovalency in closo -monocarbaborate anion and of anion mixing have yet to be fully investigated so far , the three types of frustration and additional factors mentioned above serve to flatten the energy landscape of cation migration , resulting in high ionic conductivity .

Divalent cations can also introduce cation vacancies ; however , Lu and Ciucci demonstrated that the diffusion of divalent cations ( Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ) is much slower in a lattice of [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -anions than the monovalent ones ( 127 ). Therefore , the partial substitution of the monovalent cations by divalent ones reduces ionic conductivity , which is in line with the results in halide solid electrolytes ( 163 ). Additionally , apart from the C-H bond in [ CB11 H 12 ] - , the relative Mulliken charges of [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -and [ CB11 H 12 ] -anions exhibit almost charge neutrality of exo -H atoms ( 42 ), which mitigate anion-cation Coulomb interactions . Therefore , partial or full halogenation of closo -hydroborates lowers ionic conductivity because more negatively charged halogen atoms than H atoms trap cations more due to stronger Coulomb interactions ( 87 -89 ). The stronger anion-cation interactions align hydroborate anions in the crystal structure and hinder anion reorientational motions , which is unfavorable for ion conduction .

To summarize , computational methods serve as a powerful tool to understand the dynamics of ion conduction in hydroborate solid electrolytes , providing design principles for fast ion conductors . Further enhancement of ionic conductivity in hydroborate solid electrolytes would facilitate fast all -solid -state battery charging/discharging at lower operating temperatures .

## 3 . 2 . Intrinsic Electrochemical Stability &amp; Interface Stability

In addition to ionic conductivity , solid electrolytes need to meet many criteria for successful implementation in all -solid -state batteries . Amongthem , one of the key parameters for stable battery cycling is the intrinsic electrochemical stability window of the solid electrolytes to ensure interface stability upon electrochemical reactions . In thermodynamic equilibrium , it can be evaluated by the construction of ground -potential phase diagrams under external potentials based on density functional theory ( DFT ) calculations . The consideration of external potentials was proposed by Zhu et al . ( 164 , 165 ) and Richards et al . ( 166 , 167 ) In this methodology , a stable phase can be predicted by computing the lower convex hull of the grand potential Φ (= the characteristic state function of the grand canonical ensemble ) in a given chemical and composition space . In Eq . ( 4 ), μ M is the chemical potential of the alkali metal M , while n M ( c ) and E ( c ) represent the number of the alkali metal and the enthalpy of composition c , respectively . Phase diagrams and E ( c ) are based on DFT -computed bulk energies of materials obtained from databases such as the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database ( ICSD ) and the Materials Project ( 168 ).

As shown above , the electrochemical potential μ M is dependent on its chemical potential of elemental M μ 0 M and applied external potential ϕ ( referenced to M ). Therefore , by computing the grand -potential phase diagrams with ϕ varied , the electrochemical stability window of a phase of interest can be calculated as the range of potentials ϕ within which the specific phase is the most stable . Note that no kinetic effects are considered and that the compositional phase diagrams are constructed at the ground state ( 0 K and 0 atm ); therefore , there would be small changes in free energy at ambient temperature and pressure . One of the simplest examples is the calculated electrochemical stability windows of Li and Na binary compounds shown in Figure 11a . It is worth noting that all of them are thermodynamically stable down to 0 V vs M + / M ( M = Li , Na ) and basically govern the oxidative stability limit of more complex compounds ( 166 , 167 ). For example , the oxidative stability of LiCl ( ~4 . 2 V vs Li + /Li ) determines the oxidative stability limit of LiM -Cl ternary compounds ( 169 , 170 ). Two of the exceptions are hydroborates and phosphates , whose oxidative stability is not limited by that of M Hand M 2 O ( or M 3 P ), respectively , thanks to strongly bound polyanions ( 166 ).

Lu and Ciucci , and Lacivita et al . applied this methodology to some of the metal hydroborates , e . g . LiBH 4 , Li 2 B12 H 12 , NaBH4 , and Na 2 B 12 H12 ( 127 , 166 , 167 ). Figure 11b , c show the compositional phase diagram of Li-B-H and calculated electrochemical stability windows of the four kinds of hydroborates . For reductive stability , Li hydroborates are shown to be thermodynamically unstable in contact with Li metal ( 0 V vs Li + /Li ), while Na equivalents are shown to be stable with Na metal ( 0 V vs Na + /Na = ~0 . 3 V vs Li + /Li ). These estimations are confirmed experimentally by interphase formation from LiBH 4 in contact with Li metal and by the absence of interphase

formation from Na 4 ( B12 H 12 )( B10 H 10 ) in contact with Na metal , respectively ( 126 , 142 ). Furthermore , the stability of decomposition products also directly influence interface stability . At very low potentials ( ~0 V vs Li + /Li ), Li hydroborates are calculated to be reduced to binary compounds such as LiH and LiB , which can serve as an interface passivating layer ( 127 ). In fact , the interphase formed between LiBH 4 and Li metal is shown to be stable over electrochemical Li deposition/depletion in a Li symmetric cell ( 126 ).

For oxidative stability , [ BH4 ] -is calculated to be decomposed to [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -above 2 V vs M + / M ( M = Li , Na ) ( 127 , 166 ), which matches recent experimental observations by linear sweep voltammetry ( 133 ) and the thermal decomposition behavior ( 171 -175 ). The [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -interphase formed by [ BH4 ] -decomposition enables battery cycling with LiBH 4 above its oxidative stability limit ( 176 ). On the other hand , [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -is calculated to decompose to neutral B 9 H 11 above 3 . 5 Vvs M + / M ( M = Li , Na ) ( 127 , 167 ), which is not far from experimental observation in Na 2 B 12 H 12 above 3 . 45 V vs Na + /Na ( 54 ). However , this calculation result does not consider dimerization to [ B24 H 23 ] 3 - (= two B 12 clusters connected by one 3c2e B-H-B bridging bond ) ( 177 -179 ) that was observed in a [ B12 H 12 ] 2 -solution ( 180 , 181 ). Since the structural stability of the B 12 icosahedra prevents cage opening or change in the cluster size , dimerization is expected to occur also in the solid state . This mismatch is due to the absence of information on dimers in the available databases , indicating the incapability of stability calculations based on existing databases that may not list all possible decomposition products .

In the case of an open -cage nido -hydroborate [ B11 H 14 ] - , the electrochemical stability window of its Li and Na salts is shown to be narrower than closo -hydroborates , resulting in the incompatibility with the respective Li or Na metal anodes ( 44 , 45 ). For the oxidative stability , the nido -hydroborate [ B11 H 14 ] -starts to decompose above 2 . 6 V vs M + / M ( M = Li , Na ) in mixed -anion solid electrolytes with expected dimerization ( 44 , 45 ), proposing that not only the size but also the structural stability of hydroborate anions needs to be considered to design highly conductive and highly stable hydroborate solid electrolytes for high -voltage all -solid -state batteries .

On the other hand , partial or full halogenation ( F , Cl , Br ) of closo -hydroborates is expected theoretically and shown experimentally to enhance the electrochemical oxidative stability ( 182 -186 ). However , as discussed above , halogenation generally tends to hinder the dynamic motion of the hydroborate anions and hence lowers the ionic conductivity by several orders of magnitudes ( 87 -89 ); therefore , a compromise has to be found between the ionic conductivity and oxidative stability . Alternatively , halogenated hydroborates may be used as a thin cathode protection layer , for which the ionic conductivity is less crucial than for bulk solid electrolytes .

Thestability calculations determined from the phase diagrams were further employed to evaluate the interfacial reactivity between various solid electrolytes and cathodes ( 166 , 167 , 187 ). A heat map can be drawn by calculating the maximum driving force of inter -mixing reactions between a solid electrolyte material and a cathode active material . However , as is the case with electrochemical stability calculations , the reliability of interface stability calculations is limited by the physical property data available in the databases . For example , one of the decomposition products from the interfacial reactions between Na 2 B 12 H 12 and half -charged Na 0 . 5 CrO 2 at ~3 V vs Na + /Na is predicted to be NaBH 4 , even though NaBH 4 is calculated to be unstable above 2V vs Na + /Na

( 167 ). Such limitations supposedly led to the overestimation of the reactivity of 3 V -class cathodes Na TM O2 ( TM = Cr , Mn , Fe ) with a hydroborate solid electrolyte Na 4 ( B12 H 12 )( B10 H 10 ), which is shown to be less reactive than a combination of Na TM O2 with Na 3 PS 4 or Na 3 PSe 4 ( 188 , 189 ), in contrast to thermodynamic calculations .

Therefore , more experimental data on thermodynamic properties of reaction intermediates and products are required to improve the theoretical predictions of intrinsic electrochemical stability of hydroborates and their interface stability with electrodes . Also , the effect of heteroatom ( s ) and of chemical modifications in hydroborates on their stability , and thermal and electrochemical decomposition pathways of hydroborates in the solid state are yet underexplored .

## 3 . 3 . Mechanical Properties

Since the initial contact and stability of solid -solid interfaces are crucial for stable all -solid -state battery cycling , the mechanical properties of solid electrolyte materials have a large influence on device processing . One of the important parameters is the so -called Pugh ' s ratio ( B / G ), which is a ratio of the bulk modulus ( B ) and the shear modulus ( G ) ( 190 ). Materials with B / G &gt; 1 . 75 are classified as ' ductile ,' while with B / G &lt; 1 . 75 classified as ' brittle .'

Lu and Ciucci conducted ab initio calculations of bulk and shear modulus and Pugh ' s ratio for M BH4 , M 2 B 10 H 10 , and M 2 B 12 H 12 ( M = Li , Na ). They clarified that all of these hydroborates are likely ductile in nature ( B / G &gt; 1 . 75 or G / B &lt; 0 . 57 ) with B and G up to 17 GPa and 9 GPa , respectively ( see Figure 12a ) ( 127 ). This characteristic is advantageous for facile pelletization by simple cold pressing compared to brittle oxide solid electrolytes that require sintering at high temperatures . Such ductile properties of hydroborates are similar to sulfide solid electrolytes but with even lower bulk and shear modulus , and hence Young ' s modulus ( see Figure 12b ) ( 191 , 192 ). In most cases , Li hydroborates exhibit higher bulk and shear modulus than Na hydroborates . This trend is in line with other material classes of solid electrolytes ( 191 ). Moury et al . further discovered the phase transitions of Na 2 B 12 H 12 at high pressure with a decrease in bulk modulus , for which the experimental and computational values agree well ( 193 ). This suggests that pelletizing conditions influence the mechanical properties and their hysteresis as well as the relative density of ductile solid electrolyte pellets .

The shear modulus of a solid electrolyte is also proposed to be one of the indicators for dendrite formation , which is required to be more than double the shear modulus of the respective alkali metal to hinder dendrite formation ( 194 ). This corresponds to around 8 GPa and 7 GPa for Li and Na metal at room temperature , respectively . Not all the shear moduli of hydroborates exceed these criteria according to Figure 12a ( 127 ); however , the experimental validations of the criteria have to be carried out carefully because the surface conditions of solid electrolytes as well as temperature and applied external pressure severely affect the dendrite formation ( 195 -199 ). Moreover , superionic hydroborate solid electrolytes typically comprise mixed hydroborate anions . Thus , the effect of anion mixing on mechanical properties also needs to be taken into account in future studies . More detailed understanding of the mechanical properties of hydroborates enables more systematic optimization of pelletization conditions to fabricate a thinner solid electrolyte layer in all -solid -state batteries .

## 4 . Conclusion &amp; Perspectives

The fundamental characteristics of delocalized chemical bonds and the unusual stability of hydroborate clusters have recently facilitated the applications of hydroborates as fast ion -conducting solid electrolytes for all -solid -state batteries . The current research topics of hydroborate solid electrolytes focus on closo -and nido -hydroborates , closo -monocarbaborates , and their halogenated derivatives with 10 or 12 vertices ( n = 10 , 12 ), leading to the successful implementation into 4 V all -solid -state batteries with very stable cycling performance . Material properties required for solid electrolytes , e . g . electrochemical stability and mechanical stability , are computationally predicted for someofthese hydroborates , enabling direct comparison to other material classes of solid electrolytes . Note that modeling is based on many assumptions , which have to be carefully made with a comprehensive understanding of real phenomena observed in experiments . Furthermore , experimental data on the physical/thermodynamic properties of hydroborates are still lacking . Expanding the current databases or creating a new database specialized for cluster compounds would improve the validity of computational studies on hydroborates .

The development of novel hydroborate solid electrolytes based on certain design principles is another important research target . Adjusting the cation -to -anion radius ratio and the related cation diffusion pathways helps to enhance the ionic conductivity of hydroborates from the structural aspect ( 33 ). For Li + conduction , it is proposed to reduce the cluster size of a hydroborate anion ( 45 ). One of the candidates in this strategy is to employ closo -monocarbaborates [ CB n -1 H n ] -with smaller cages ( n = 7-9 ), which have already been synthesized experimentally ( 200 -202 ). According to the theoretical calculations , this approach may sacrifice the stability of the anion cluster ( 12 , 203 ), which would have to be mitigated by chemical modifications , anion mixing , or artificial interface protection .

Alternatively , the incorporation of two carbon ( C ) atoms or another heteroatom in hydroborates can simultaneously break the symmetry of hydroborate cages and reduce the density of cations , which can be used as a component for anion mixing . Potential candidates include C 2 B n -2 H n , NB n -1 H n , OB n -1 H n -1 , SB n -1 H n -1 , PB n -1 H n , and [ SiB n -1 H n ] - ( n = 10 , 12 ). Many of them are only computationally modeled ( 204 -206 ), but 1 , 2 -, 1 , 6 -and 1 , 10 -C2 B 8 H 10 ( 207 ), 1 , 2 -, 1 , 7 -and 1 , 12 -C2 B 10 H 12 ( 11 ), 1 -NB9H10 ( 208 ), NB11 H 12 ( 209 ) 1 -SB 9 H 9 ( 210 ), and 1 -SB 11 H 11 ( 211 , 212 ) have already been synthesized experimentally . Mixing these neutral heteroboranes or negatively charged heteroborates with closo -hydroborates or monocarbaborates might lower the activation barrier of anionic reorientational motion , the phase -transition temperature , and the number of cation per formula unit to less than one , leading to enhanced ionic conductivity . Chemical modifications of exo -hydrogen ( H ) atoms with a non -polar functional group in closo -hydroborates and monocarbaborates would also be effective to increase anion asymmetry and dynamic frustration .

Overall , a combination of ( i ) cluster size and shape of hydroborates , ( ii ) the number , species , and position of heteroatoms , ( iii ) the number , species , and position of chemical modifications of exo -H atoms , and ( iv ) binary or ternary anion mixing produces a vast number of possibilities for hydroborate derivatives and their isomers . Computational studies offer a powerful tool to pre -screen such a large number of combinations to seek for better solid electrolytes ; therefore , close collaboration between scientists in theory and experiments plays a more and more important role in exploring an oceanic playground of hydroborate compounds for high ion conduction and structural stability .

In summary , the continuous research on hydroborate solid electrolytes and hydroborate -based all -solid -state batteries creates a substantial impact on the development of next -generation energy storage devices , facilitating the sustainable energy transition in the long run . Furthermore , these efforts also contribute to pushing the boundary of boron chemistry and its applications to other fields e . g . in medicine ( 14 -17 , 213 ).
