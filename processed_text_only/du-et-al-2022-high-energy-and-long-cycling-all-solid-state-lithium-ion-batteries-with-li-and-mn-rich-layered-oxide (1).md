ABSTRACT: All-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLIBs) are considered the most promising option for next-generation high-energy and safe batteries. Herein, a practical all-solid-state battery, with a Li- and Mn-rich layered oxide (LMRO) as the cathode and Li6PS5Cl as the electrolyte, is demonstrated for the first time. The battery delivers the most exceptional performance by far in terms of ultrahigh capacity of 244.5 mA h g -1 and unprecedented cycling stability with an 83% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. We discover that the Li6PS5Cl can be reversibly oxidized and reduced within the voltage range 2.0 -4.8 V, which is beneficial to the ionic conduction during long-term cycling of ASSLIBs. Moreover, the electronic and ionic conductivities of LMROs are increased by 4 orders of magnitude via precisely tailoring the composition and structure. In addition, the typical dissolution of transition metal, oxygen release, and phase

transformation of LMROs in liquid batteries are substantially eliminated in ASSLIBs.

A ll-solid-state lithium-ion batteries (ASSLIBs) with nonflammable solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted widespread attention in recent years and are considered to be a promising next-generation energy storage devices for electric vehicles. 1 -3 Currently, LiCoO2 (LCO) and Ni-rich LiNi(1 -x -y )Co x Mn y O2 (NCM) cathodes for ASSLIBs have been extensively investigated due to their moderate working voltage (4.3 V) and high electrical conductivity (10 -5 -10 -3 S cm -1 ). 3 -7 However, the practical capacities and energy densities of these cathodes are limited to approximately 200 mA h g -1 and 760 W h kg -1 , respectively, which cannot satisfy the ambitious requirements of high-energy batteries. 8,9 In this regard, Li- and Mn-rich layered oxides (LMROs) with the chemical formula of x Li2MnO3 · (1 -x )LiTMO2 (TM = Ni, Co, Mn, etc.), which have been widely studied in liquid batteries, possess much higher reversible capacities (&gt;280 mA h g -1 ) and energy densities (&gt;1000 W h kg -1 ) than the aforementioned traditional cathode materials. 10,11 Moreover, the dissolution of transition metal elements (TMs) from the cathode to the liquid electrolyte, which results in significant capacity degradation of LMROs, 12,13 can be circumvented in ASSLIBs. 6,14 Therefore, LMROs have great potential to realize high-energy ASSLIBs with excellent cycling stability once

compatible SEs are preselected. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the application of LMROs in ASSLIBs, which can be ascribed to their high working voltage (4.8 V) and extremely low electronic ( ∼ 10 -9 -10 -8 S cm -1 ) and ionic ( ∼ 10 -11 S cm -1 ) conductivities. 15,16

With regard to the SEs, theoretical calculations and experimental results show that elemental S in the sulfide electrolytes undergoes oxidative decomposition above 2.5 V. 5,17,18 Therefore, sulfide electrolytes in traditional ASSLIBs with LCO or NCM cathodes, which usually work within the voltage range 2.5 -4.3 V, undergo continuous decomposition accompanied by generation of insulating -S 0 -species upon cycling, which results in increased interfacial resistance and capacity fading. 19,20 Notably, the decomposition behavior of SEs gets worse at a higher charge cutoff voltage of

ASSLIBs. 21,22 Basically, the interfaces between the sulfide electrolytes and cathodes in ASSLIBs would remain efficient if the generated -S 0 -species could be reduced during the discharge process. In the field of Li -S batteries, it is widely reported that the S 0 can be reduced within the range 2.0 -2.3 V. 23,24 Considering that the discharge cutoff voltage of LMROs is 2.0 V, we speculate that combining LMROs with sulfide electrolytes in ASSLIBs might mitigate the deterioration of the cathode -electrolyte interface and hence enable enhanced cycling stability. Among the various sulfide electrolytes, lithium argyrodite Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) is regarded as the most promising one for ASSLIBs due to its high ionic conductivity (10 -3 -10 -2 S cm -1 ), 25 -27 low cost, 28 and favorable mechanical properties for processing. 3,29 Herein, for the first time, a practical ASSLIB is demonstrated, with LMROs as the cathodes and Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) as the electrolyte. The electrochemical performance of LMROs is significantly improved by proper composition modulation to achieve high electronic and ionic conductivities. The battery delivers breakthrough performance with ultrahigh discharge capacity and energy density as well as unprecedented cycling stability.

The synthesis of LPSCl electrolytes and LMRO cathodes used in this work and the assembly process of ASSLIBs are shown in the Experimental Section in the SI, Figures S1 -S3 and Note S1. In order to address concern on insufficient conductivity of LMROs toward ASSLIBs, we first regulate the Co contents in 0.5LiNi0.33 Co0.33+ x Mn0.33 -x O2 -0.5Li2MnO3

(samples are denoted LRCo0, LRCo05, LRCo10, LRCo15, LRCo20, LRCo25, and LRCo33 for x = 0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, and 0.33, respectively) to alter the electronic and ionic conductivities. As shown in Figure 1a, with the increase of Co content, the strength of the superlattice peaks decreases, accompanied by the decrease of the content of C 2/ m phase (Figure 1b), and consequently, both the electronic and ionic conductivities of LMROs increase significantly (Figure 1b and Figure S4). For t h e t y p i c a l LMRO cathode Li 1.2 Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2 (LRCo0), due to its low electronic conductivity (3.44 × 10 -9 S cm -1 ) and ionic conductivity (2.65 × 10 -10 S cm -1 ) (Figure 1b), the plateau around 4.5 V associated with the oxygen redox almost does not appear, and the discharge capacity is only 130 mA h g -1 in ASSLIBs (Figure 1c), which is far lower than the capacity delivered by the battery with a liquid electrolyte (Figure S5a,b). The poor conductivity of LRCo0 also leads to the inferior cycling performance in the ASSLIB (Figure 1d). When the Co content is increased, the electronic and ionic conductivities of LMROs are increased, and the electrochemical performance of ASSLIBs is greatly improved (Figure 1c,d). It should be noted that increasing the Co content could reduce the discharge capacity and deteriorate the cycling stability of LMROs in liquid batteries (Figure S5), as reported in the literature. 30,31 Interestingly, we found that the cathodes with increased Co content exhibit higher discharge capacities and capacity retention than those of LRCo0 in ASSLIBs in this

work, demonstrating the importance of conductivity improvement and the great potential of LMROs in ASSLIBs. Considering the trade-off between electrochemical performance and electrical conductivity, LRCo10 is screened as the optimized composition and shows the best electrochemical performance in ASSLIBs with a high capacity of 213.4 mA h g -1 (Figure 1d).

According to our previous work, 32 the addition of the nominal LiNiO2 component in the LMRO cathode can significantly enhance the structural stability and electrochemical performance, while the effects of the LiNiO2 component on the performance of LMROs in ASSLIBs are not clear and are expected to be positive. LRCo10 -y LiNiO2 ( y = 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10) composite cathodes (labeled as LRCo10@3LN, LRCo10@5LN, LRCo10@7LN, and

LRCo10@10LN, respectively) were synthesized to further improve the performance of ASSLIBs. All LRCo10 -y LiNiO2 cathodes show the same bulk α -NaFeO2-type layered structure (Figure 2a), whereas the surface structure varies significantly with the increase of the LiNiO 2 content. The LRCo10 cathode has a uniform layered structure from the surface to the bulk (Figure 2b), while a spinel-like phase is formed on the surface of LRCo10@10LN (Figure 2c). In addition, the electronic and ionic conductivities of the LRCo10@yLN cathodes were measured by the ion-blocking cell and electron-blocking cell, respectively (Figure S6), and the results are summarized in Figure 2d. It can be fantastically found that increasing the content of LiNiO2 could drastically increase the electronic and ionic conductivities of LMROs. Specifically, the electronic conductivities of LRCo10@5LN and LRCo10@10LN are 1.82 × 10 -5 and 7.36 × 10 -5 S cm -1 , respectively, which are 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of LRCo0 and reach the level of NCM cathodes. 5,33

The electrochemical performance of LRCo10@yLN in ASSLIBs was investigated comprehensively at room temperature. As seen from the first charge/discharge curves at 0.1C (1C = 200 mA g -1 ) (Figure 2e), all of the samples display similar profiles with a sloping line below 4.4 V and a plateau between 4.4 and 4.6 V, corresponding to the cationic redox and oxygen redox, respectively, which is similar to the case in liquid batteries (Figure S7a). Although the practical capacities obtained from liquid batteries is decreased with the increase of the LiNiO2 content (Figure S7b), the discharge capacities of LRCo10@3LN and LRCo10@5LN in ASSLIBs are higher than that of LRCo10, which is benefitted from the enhanced electronic and ionic conduction in the composite cathode. Remarkably, the LRCo10@5LN cathode can deliver a high capacity of 244.5 mA h g -1 after 10 activation cycles (Figure 2f), which is comparable to the capacity in the liquid battery, and this represents the highest value reported to date for oxide cathodes in ASSLIBs. The initial discharge capacity is slightly decreased with further increasing the LiNiO 2 content, whereas the cycling stability is substantially improved. The specific capacity of LRCo10 quickly declines from 213.4 to 116.2 mA h g -1 after 100 cycles at 0.1C with a capacity retention of 54%. In contrast, LRCo10@5LN maintains 85% of the maximum capacity after 100 cycles, and LRCo10@10LN shows no capacity fading during 100 cycles at 0.1C (Figure 2f). Longterm cycling stability of LMROs in ASSLIBs was further tested at 0.5C (Figure 2g). At the high rate of 0.5C, the LRCo10 cathode with relatively low conductivity undergoes a quick capacity decay and retains only 25% of the initial capacity after 700 cycles, whereas all LRCo10@yLN cathodes exhibit higher discharge capacities and capacity retention than those of LRCo10 due to the increased conductivity and the presence of the spinel/layered heterostructure. Notably, the discharge capacity of the optimized LRCo10@10LN cathode is maintained with negligible decline over hundreds of cycles and still shows 90% capacity retention after 700 cycles. Compared with the electrochemical performance of previously reported high-voltage oxide cathodes in sulfide-based ASSLIBs at room temperature (Table S1), our LMRO cathodes clearly

exhibit the highest energy density and best cycling performance by far.

The performances of LRCo10@5LN and LRCo10@10LN in ASSLIBs and liquid batteries were further compared to reflect the superiority of ASSLIBs. Although the initial specific capacities of ASSLIBs are slightly lower than those of liquid batteries, ASSLIBs exhibit much better cycling stability during long-term cycling (Figure 2h and Figure S7c,d). Specifically, LRCo10@10LN shows a high capacity retention of 83% after 1000 cycles in an ASSLIB, which is far superior to the performance in a conventional liquid battery (36%). Moreover, the Coulombic efficiency of the ASSLIB is quite stable during long-term cycling, and the average value reaches up to 99.96% (Figure 2h). In contrast, the Coulombic efficiency of the liquid battery fluctuates greatly during cycling, and the average value is lower than that of the ASSLIB, which can be ascribed to crossover of TMs dissolved from the LMRO cathode to the Li metal anode. 34,35 Therefore, ASSLIBs provide a more promising opportunity for the practical application of highenergy LMRO cathodes by eliminating the dissolution of TMs.

In order to elucidate the electrochemical stability of LPSCl during cycling, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were first performed for different voltage ranges based on LPSCl + vapor-grown carbon fibers (VGCF)/LPSCl/In -Li cells. In the voltage range between 2.0 and 4.8 V, which is a typical working voltage range for LMRO cathodes, LPSCl starts to oxidize at approximately 2.5 V during the first cycle, and it undergoes partial reduction starting at around 2.3 V (Figure 3a). The oxidation process can be ascribed to oxidation of PS 4 3 -(PS4 3 -→ -S 0 -+ P2S7 4 -), 18 and the reduction process can be attributed to reduction of -S 0 -( -S 0 - → S 2 -). 18,36 During the following cycles, the decomposition of LPSCl is kinetically inhibited due to the passivated decomposition layer formed at the surface during the first cycle, 5 while the decomposition is still reversible, which is vital for maintaining efficient charge transfer channels at the cathode -electrolyte interface. When the voltage range is adjusted to 2.5 -4.8 V, there are no reduction peaks produced during the cathodic scans (Figure 3b), suggesting that the -S 0 -species cannot be reduced in this voltage range. It is worth noting that the discharge cutoff voltages of the LCO and NCM cathodes are generally above 2.5 V. Therefore, the -S 0 -species in LCO- or NCM-based ASSLIBs cannot be reduced, and there is always a strong -S 0 -peak in the S 2p XPS spectra of cycled LCO or NCM in ASSLIBs. 37 -40 The accumulated -S 0 -species will block the electron and ion transport and increase the interfacial resistance, eventually inducing capacity fading. However, decreasing the discharge cutoff voltage of LCO ASSLIB to 2.0 V cannot improve the cycling performance because the overintercalation of lithium would deteriorate the battery performance (Figure S8), further demonstrating the superiority of the combination of LMROs and sulfide electrolytes. In addition, it should be noted that, although LPSCl can be reversibly redox within 2.0 -4.8 V, it can only provide a discharge capacity of about 3 mA h g -1 within 2.3 -2.0 V during the discharge process (Figure S9). Therefore, the discharge capacity of LMRO-based ASSLIB mainly comes from the LMRO cathode itself.

To further demonstrate the oxidation and reduction of LPSCl in LMRO-based ASSLIBs during cycling, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out with the LRCo10@10LN composite cathode during cycling to reveal the redox process of LPSCl. The S 2p spectrum of pristine LPSCl consists of a main doublet peak at 161.4 eV corresponding to the PS4 3 -tetrahedral of the argyrodite structure (P -S -Li bonds) and a minor peak at 160.0 eV stemming from free S 2 -anions in LPSCl and Li2S impurities (Figure 3c). 41,42 For the pristine LRCo10@10LN composite cathode, the peak at 160.0 eV disappears, and another doublet peak located at a higher binding energy of 163.0 eV corresponding to the P2S7 4 -ditetrahedra (P -S -P) 19,43 appears due to slight oxidation of LPSCl during the preparation of the composite cathode. When charging to 4.8 V, the PS4 3 -of LPSCl is electrochemically oxidized to P 2S7 4 -

and polysulfide species ( -S 0 -, 163.6 eV). 18,44 Importantly, the -S 0 -species can be completely reduced during the following discharge process, suggesting that the oxidative decomposition of LPSCl is indeed reversible in one charge/discharge cycle. Although the S 2p spectrum in the discharged state is not completely restored to the pristine LPSCl spectrum, it should be noted that the decomposition occurs only on the surface of LPSCl, and the P2S7 4 -ions are also favorable for Li + conduction as it is an important component for the superionic conductor Li7P3S11. 43,45 After 1000 cycles, the main peaks of the S 2p spectrum can still be assigned to PS4 3 -and P2S7 4 -ions, and the -S 0 -peak does not emerge (Figure 3c), indicating that LPSCl can maintain reversible redox processes and enable good ionic conduction during long-term cycling. The reversible oxidation and reduction of LPSCl can also be verified by P 2p spectra (Figure 3d). The PS 4 3 -(131.9 eV) is oxidized to P 2S7 4 -(132.5 eV) and PS x O y 3 -(133.9 eV) during the charge process, and the oxidized phosphorus is partially reduced back after discharging. It can be seen that phosphorus exhibits a higher degree of oxidation than sulfur, which is consistent with the results reported by Janek et al. 37 In addition, the impedance variation of the ASSLIB during cycling is monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The LRCo10@10LN/LPSCl interfacial resistance ( R cathode ) increases during charging and decreases during discharging (Figure S10a,b), validating the reversible oxidation and reduction of LPSCl. In addition, the R cathode is only increased from 39 Ω (first cycle) to 262 Ω (1000 cycles), which is much smaller than the increase seen for the liquid battery (1989 Ω ) (Figure S10c -f). Furthermore, owing to the lower Young's modulus ( ∼ 20 GPa) of the sulfide electrolyte as compared to those of oxide materials (100 -200 GPa), 46 the sulfide electrolyte is capable of accommodating volume expansion ( ∼ 2%) of the LMRO 12,47 during cycling. There are no cracks appearing after 1000 cycles, and the LPSCl electrolyte and LRCo10@10LN cathode remain in close contact (Figure S11). Therefore, the reversible decomposition of LPSCl and intense interfacial contact ensure a sufficient Li + pathway in the composite cathode during long-term cycling and hence contribute to the superior cycling stability of the ASSLIBs.

The crystal structures of the LRCo10@10LN cathode in the liquid battery and ASSLIB were studied after 1000 cycles by HAADF-STEM to demonstrate the superiority of the ASSLIB for LMRO cathodes. The lattice fringes of LRCo10@10LN are severely destroyed in the liquid battery, and many nanovoids are generated in the whole particle after 1000 cycles due to the irreversible oxygen release and the dissolution of TMs 48 (Figure 4a). In addition, the atomic arrangements of the LRCo10@10LN cathode after cycling are matched well with the spinel-like Li x Mn2O4 phase (Figure 4a,b), which is further confirmed by the corresponding fast Fourier transformation (FFT) (Figure 4c). Therefore, the considerable layered structure of LRCo10@10LN is transformed into the spinellike phase after 1000 cycles in the liquid battery. In comparison, the LRCo10@10LN cathode in the ASSLIB maintains good structural integrity without any nanovoids, and the LPSCl electrolyte is still coated on the cathode surface after long cycles (Figure 4d). Taking a closer look at the interface between LPSCl and the LRCo10@10LN cathode (Figure 4e), the lattice of the cathode surface is well sustained, and only about 2 unit cells are damaged. Moreover, the 6 nm thick spinel-like phase on the surface of our designed LRCo10@

10LN is preserved (Figure 4e,f), and the interior area still maintains a good layered structure (Figure 4g,h). These results clearly demonstrate that the dissolution of TMs and phase transformation from layered to spinel-like phases in LMROs, which are commonly seen in liquid batteries, 12,48 are substantially suppressed in ASSLIBs. Furthermore, according to the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) results (Figure S12 and Note S2), the LRCo10@10LN cathode underwent serious oxygen release (50 nm deep) in a liquid battery after 1000 cycles, whereas the oxygen release occurs only in the 4 nm deep surface area in the sulfide-based ASSLIBs. Therefore, the stubborn oxygen release problem of LMROs, which is a critical challenge for liquid batteries, can also be significantly suppressed in sulfide-based ASSLIBs.

In summary, we demonstrated practical ASSLIB chemistry with LMRO cathodes and LPSCl electrolyte. The optimal LMRO-based ASSLIBs exhibit a high discharge capacity (244.5 mA h g -1 ), high energy density (853 W h kg -1 ), and excellent long-term cycling stability far superior to the liquid batteries. The LPSCl electrolyte can be reversibly oxidized and reduced during the charge/discharge process between 2.0 and 4.8 V. The discharge cutoff voltage of 2.0 V is essential for the reduction of the -S 0 -species, which is beneficial for maintaining efficient interfacial charge transfer channels and achieving excellent cycling stability of ASSLIBs. More importantly, the electronic and ionic conductivities of LMROs are increased by 4 orders of magnitude via simply tuning the content of Co and LiNiO2 components. In addition, the dissolution of TMs, oxygen release, and phase transformation from the layered to spinel-like phases of LMRO cathodes can be greatly suppressed in ASSLIBs. Our findings shed light on the practical application of LMRO cathodes in ASSLIBs and enrich the understanding of the interface between high-voltage oxide cathodes and sulfide electrolytes.
