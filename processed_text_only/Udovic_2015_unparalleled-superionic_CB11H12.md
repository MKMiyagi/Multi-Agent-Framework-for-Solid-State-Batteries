## Broader context

With the expanding interest in electric vehicles, the management of renewable energy, and other greener technologies in today's world, the need for improved energy-storage devices that deliver more power with higher capacities is ever increasing. Moreover, there is a growing desire to improve on the versatility, safety, and cycle-life afforded by the current device technologies, which typically incorporate organic-based liquid electrolytes. Hence there has been a general push to eliminate these liquid electrolytes in favor of all-solid-state devices using safe, stable, solid-state electrolytes. Until recently, the latter materials under consideration have been more ceramic or polymer-based. Complex-hydride materials, and more recently, large-polyhedral-anion-based materials such as LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 reported here are emerging as intriguing alternatives to these more traditional candidates. We believe that these newer types of solid-state electrolytes show great promise and deserve increased scrutiny as viable components of next-generation energy-storage devices.

## Introduction

Based on their ability to form entropy-driven, cation- and aniondisordered structures, some complex hydride salts such as LiBH4 and Na2BH4NH2 have been found to exhibit impressive ionic conductivity, 1,2 meriting their consideration as technologically

useful solid-state electrolytes 3,4 and jumpstarting further efforts to find even more promising ionic conductors within this broad class of materials. 5 More recently, the disordered phases of polyhedral boron-hydrogen compounds of Na containing the relatively stable dodecahydrocloso -dodecaborate (B12H12 2 /C0 ) and decahydrocloso -decaborate (B10H10 2 /C0 ) anions have proved to be quite remarkable superionic conductors, 6-9 likely aided in part by the capacious interstitial corridors for cation transport afforded by the sublattice of unusually large quasispherical anions.

## Unparalleled lithium and sodium superionic conduction in solid electrolytes with large monovalent cage-like anions †

Wan Si Tang,* ab Atsushi Unemoto, c Wei Zhou, a Vitalie Stavila, d Motoaki Matsuo, e Hui Wu, a Shin-ichi Orimo* ce and Terrence J. Udovic* a

Solid electrolytes with sufficiently high conductivities and stabilities are the elusive answer to the inherent shortcomings of organic liquid electrolytes prevalent in today's rechargeable batteries. We recently revealed a novel fast-ion-conducting sodium salt, Na2B12H12, which contains large, icosahedral, divalent B12H12 2 /C0 anions that enable impressive superionic conductivity, albeit only above its 529 K phase transition. Its lithium congener, Li2B12H12, possesses an even more technologically prohibitive transition temperature above 600 K. Here we show that the chemically related LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 salts, which contain icosahedral, monovalent CB11H12 /C0 anions, both exhibit much lower transition temperatures near 400 K and 380 K, respectively, and truly stellar ionic conductivities ( 4 0.1 S cm /C0 1 ) unmatched by any other known polycrystalline materials at these temperatures. With proper modifications, we are confident that room-temperature-stabilized superionic salts incorporating such large polyhedral anion building blocks are attainable, thus enhancing their future prospects as practical electrolyte materials in next-generation, all-solid-state batteries.

In spite of such compounds possessing the requisite conductivities for incorporation as electrolytes in next-generation, all-solid-state rechargeable batteries, it is highly desirable from a technology perspective to be able to stabilize the disordered superionic phase closer to or below room temperature, e.g. , via tailored chemical modifications that lead to either lower thermodynamically dictated ( T trans E D H trans / D S trans ) phasetransition temperatures or a kinetics-inhibited low-temperature trapping of the high-temperature disorder. For instance, Na2B10H10 can be considered as an anion-modified form of Na2B12H12, yielding a smaller transition enthalpy change D H trans and thus a lower T trans , assuming a less-compound-dependent (order-disorder) entropy change D S trans. Partially substituting Li for Na or halogenating the B12H12 2 /C0 anion has also been shown to change the transition temperature, but in the opposite direction. 12 Na2BH4NH2 is one example of a room-temperature fast-ion conductor enabled by a ''freezing in'' of its high-temperature disordered structure down to low temperatures. 2,13 Another related example of trapping is the room-temperature stabilization of the high-temperature superionic disordered Na3PS4 phase by crystallization from glassy Na3PS4. 14,15

One obvious chemical modification of potential interest involves the alteration of the B12H12 2 /C0 anion itself. For example, replacing one {B-H} vertex with an isoelectronic {C-H} group yields the structurally similar icosahedral monocarbacloso -dodecaborate anion (CB11H12 /C0 ; see Fig. 1). The resulting reduced anion valency for CB11H12 /C0 compared to B12H12 2 /C0 leads to a halving of the number of monovalent cations required for charge neutrality of the corresponding salt compounds, LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12. A thorough review of the chemistry of the CB11H12 /C0 anion 16 suggests that it is a relatively weakly binding and chemically inert anion, 17 and indeed its potential as a viable liquid electrolyte component for Mg batteries has already been explored. 18 Yet information on the properties of its anhydrous salt compounds is generally lacking. One study for CsCB11H12 reported an endothermic transition peak (upon heating) centered at around 564 K by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and confirmed a phase change by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) to what was suggested to be a high-temperature orthorhombic

structure. 19 There was no clear evidence as to the nature of this supposedly disordered phase. Yet, based on an analogous structural study of Cs2B12H12 (which exhibits a similar cation/ anion size ratio), 20 such a phase does not necessarily possess any cation vacancies, which are paramount for fast-ion conduction. In contrast, our previous experience indicates that the formation of cation-vacancy-rich disordered structures with such large anions seems to be more common when the smaller Li + and Na + cations are involved. 6,9,10 This proclivity likely has something to do with the smaller cations favoring lower cation coordination. 11,12,21-23 In particular, the typical interstitial tetrahedral sites formed by the anions are too large for the diminutive Li + and Na + cations, forcing them to move laterally from the centers toward one of the four trigonal hollows to maximize their stability. Disorder transitions from these lower-coordination ordered structures tend to be of first-order and involve a dramatic increase in anion orientational mobility, which may further ameliorate the cation translational mobility within the anion sublattice. 8,9,24 Hence, the potential effects of the different anion valency and 1 : 1 cation/anion ratio on T trans and ionic conductivity, and the natures of the corresponding ordered and disordered LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 structures are intriguing and worthy of exploration.

In this paper, we report our results concerning the structural, dynamical, and conductive properties of LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12. We have found respective transition temperatures of around 400 K and 380 K, which are substantially lower than those for the analogous Li2B12H12 and Na2B12H12 compounds. At room temperature, LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 exhibit ordered orthorhombic structures. Above these transition temperatures, the cation-vacancy-rich, disordered cubic phases for both compounds with their unusually high anion orientational mobility exhibit, to the best of our knowledge, unparalleled superionic Li + and Na + conductivities compared to the values reported for all other known solid polycrystalline materials at similar temperatures, polyhedral-anion-based or otherwise.

## Experimental

For neutron scattering measurements, aqueous lithium and sodium monocarbacloso -dodecaborates LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 were each formed by first preparing (H3O)CB11H12 from trimethylammonium monocarbacloso dodecaborate [(CH3)3NH]CB11H12 (Katchem 25 ) by a procedure described in detail elsewhere, 9 then neutralizing the (H3O)CB11H12 with either 0.1 M 7 LiOH (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99.9+% 7 Li) or NaOH until a pH of 7 was reached. Finally, anhydrous LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 were obtained from these respective aqueous solutions, first using a rotary evaporator at room temperature to form a hydrated solid, followed by dehydration under vacuum at 433 K and 330 K, respectively, for 16 h. Boron-11 enrichment, although also desirable for neutron scattering measurements, was not considered in this study because of the added complication of needing 11 B-enriched starting materials to synthesize the CB11H12 /C0 anions. ( N.B. , both 6 Li and 10 B present in natural Li and B are strong neutron absorbers).

For all other non-neutron-related measurements, we used separate batches of LiCB11H12 (with no 7 Li enrichment) and NaCB11H12 obtained directly from Katchem.

Both anhydrous compounds were structurally characterized in quartz capillaries by XRPD using a Rigaku Ultima III X-ray diffractometer with a Cu-K a source ( l = 1.5418 Å). Elevated sample temperatures were enabled by a custom-designed, calibrated radiative/convective heat source. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were made with a Netzsch (STA 449 F1 Jupiter ) TGA-DSC under He flow with Al sample pans. Neutron scattering measurements were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research. Neutron vibrational spectroscopy (NVS) measurements were performed at 4 K using thin flat-plate sample geometries and scattering in reflection on the Filter-Analyzer Neutron Spectrometer (FANS). 26 The Cu(220) monochromator was used with pre- and post-collimations of 20 0 of arc, yielding a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) energy resolution of about 3% of the neutron energy transfer. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements were performed using the same sample geometries on the Disc Chopper Spectrometer (DCS), 27 utilizing incident neutrons at 4.1 Å (4.87 meV) with respective resolutions of 87.3 m eV and 184.4 m eV FWHM for NaCB11H12 and LiCB11H12. Spectra were collected in reflection over a useful momentum transfer ( Q ) range of around 1.0 Å /C0 1 to 2.88 Å /C0 1 . The instrument resolution function was determined from QENS spectra at 200 K. The neutron scattering data were analyzed using the DAVE software package. 28 XRPD structural refinements were performed using either GSAS 29 or Fullprof software. 30

Ionic conductivities were determined in heating and cooling runs repeatedly in the temperature range from room temperature to 433 K for LiCB11H12 and to 393 K for NaCB11H12 by the ac complex impedance method with a two-probe technique using a HIOKI 3532-80 chemical impedance meter over a frequency range of 4 Hz to 1 MHz with an input voltage perturbation of 150 mV. All measurements were performed under Ar. The powder sample was pressed into a pellet of 8 mm in diameter and approximately 2.7 mm in thickness without sintering. The pellet densities were about 1.05 g cm /C0 3 and 1.13 g cm /C0 3 , which are more than 94% of the densities calculated from the lattice parameters. Li and Au foils were used as electrodes for LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12, respectively, and mechanically fixed onto both faces of the pellet.

LiCB11H12 was used in preliminary battery tests. TiS2 (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) and LiCB11H12 powders were mixed in a 1: 1 mass ratio by an agate mortar in an agate pestle, and then used as a composite positive electrode. 25 mg of LiCB11H12 and 6 mg of the composite positive electrode powders were separately placed in an 8 mm-diameter die and then uniaxially pressed at 190 MPa. Li foil was used as a negative electrode and placed opposite of the positive electrode. The assembled bulk-type, allsolid-state TiS2/Li battery, namely TiS2/LiCB11H12|LiCB11H12|Li, was placed in a stainless-steel electrochemical cell with an 8 mm-diameter Teflon s guide, as schematically illustrated elsewhere. 3 All of the procedures for the battery assemblies were carried out in an Ar-filled glove box. The battery test was carried out at 403 K with a 0.2 C charge rate (C-rate), corresponding to

285 m A cm /C0 2 , in the voltage range of 1.75 V to 2.6 V using a 580 battery test system (Scribner Associates).

To assist the structural refinements, first-principles calculations were performed within the plane-wave implementation of the generalized gradient approximation to Density Functional Theory (DFT) using a Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft potential with Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange correlation. 31 A cutoff energy of 544 eV and a 2 /C2 2 /C2 1 k -point mesh (generated using the Monkhorst-Pack scheme) were used and found to be enough for the total energy to converge within 0.01 meV atom /C0 1 . For comparison with the NVS measurements, the phonon densities of states (PDOSs) were calculated from the DFT-optimized structures using the supercell method (2 /C2 2 /C2 1 cell size) with finite displacements. 32,33 They were weighted to take into account the H, 7 Li, Na, C, and B total neutron scattering cross sections, appropriately averaged over Q -space, and convoluted with the instrumental resolution. The PDOS of the isolated CB11H12 /C0 anion was also calculated for comparison, using a 30 /C2 30 /C2 30 supercell and full C 5v molecular symmetry. Mulliken atomic charges (shown in Fig. 1) were determined from these DFT calculations for the isolated CB11H12 /C0 anion as well as from those for the related B12H12 2 /C0 anion using the same-size supercell and its full I h molecular symmetry.

All structural depictions were made using the VESTA (Visualization for Electronic and Structural Analysis) software. 34 For all figures, standard uncertainties are commensurate with the observed scatter in the data, if not explicitly designated by vertical error bars.

## Results and discussion

Fig. 2 shows DSC scans for LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12, indicating a clear hysteretic phase change based on the respective endothermic (upon heating) and exothermic (upon cooling) enthalpic features. Here, they occur roughly near 395 K and 383 K for LiCB11H12

and near 380 K and 354 K for NaCB11H12, dramatically lower than their respective Li2B12H12 and Na2B12H12 analogs 6 and suggestive of relatively lower enthalpic changes. As evidenced for NaCB11H12 during a later DSC cycle and for all the polyhedral borate salts, these temperatures can vary 9 by more than 10 K depending on the cycling parameters and the maximum temperature employed, and seem to be intimately related to morphological changes that can occur with cycling, such as particle sintering or size reduction. We note that the inherent hystereses for these systems mean that the high-temperature phases can remain stable some degrees below the quoted T trans values, which often refer to the values observed upon heating.

The room-temperature XRPD patterns and structural model fits for LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 are shown in Fig. 3. At room temperature, LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 were both indexed to orthorhombic structures. The approximate structural details for each compound were determined using direct space methods under the same most probable space group of Pca 21 (No. 29). DFT calculations were then individually performed to optimize the CB11H12 /C0 rigid-body geometries with respect to the relative C, B, and H positions. Final Rietveld structural refinements 35 of the lattice constants and cation and anion coordinates were

The Fig. 3 insets depict the similar orthorhombic structures for LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12. In both of these ordered structures, the C atoms are not orientationally disordered amongst the various icosahedral vertices. Rather, there is a preferred vertex position for the C atom within the structures. As can be seen in Fig. 1, although the C atom has a markedly larger negative Mulliken charge than the other B atoms of the CB11H12 /C0 anion, its covalently bonded H atom has about a fivefold larger positive Mulliken charge than those for the other B-bonded H atoms. This anomalously large positive charge has a major influence on the lowest-energy orientation established by the anion and the particular crystallographic position of its C atom. As such, it is most energetically favorable for these particular H atoms to maximize their distance from the surrounding cations, 16,36 as is observed here both experimentally and by our DFT calculations.

The neutron vibrational spectra for LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 at 4 K are shown in Fig. 4 and are compared with the simulated PDOSs based on the DFT-optimized, XRPD-refined structures as well as that for the isolated CB11H12 /C0 anion. Due to the relatively large neutron scattering cross-section for H atoms compared to Li, Na, C, and B atoms, the spectrum is dominated by the various optical vibrational modes involving H-atom displacements. Hydrogen stretching modes are at higher energies and are outside the measured energy range. There is good agreement between the experimental and simulated spectra, providing

Simulated one-phonon densities of states are depicted in grey. ( N.B. , 1 meV E 8.066 cm /C0 1 .)

further credence to the refined structures. As suggested by the simulated PDOS of the isolated CB11H12 /C0 anion in Fig. 4 and borne out by PDOS results for other polyhedral hydroborate salts, 37 the neutron vibrational spectrum is typically found to be sensitive to the crystal structure arrangement.

Further information about the characters and energies of the different LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 phonon modes contributing to the simulated PDOSs can be found in the animation files in the ESI. † 38

Fig. 5 shows representative XRPD refinement results for the high-temperature disordered phase of LiCB11H12. (See Fig. S1 in the ESI, † for the NaCB11H12 refinement results.) Two different schematic views (lower inset and top) illustrate the primary disordered face-centered-cubic (fcc) structure found for both LiCB11H12 (at 430 K) and NaCB11H12 (at 356 K). The orientationally disordered anion arrangements are akin to the hightemperature disordered structures observed for Li2B12H12,

Vertical bars indicate the calculated positions of the Bragg peaks (with about 5% orthorhombic phase still present). NaCB11H12 at 356 K is isostructural with a = 10.066(3) Å. Inset is a schematic view of the disordered structure along a principal axis. Orange, green, and white spheres denote Li/Na, C/B, and H atoms, respectively. (top) An alternate view without the H atoms, better indicating the cation channels. N.B. , the disordered cation positions reflect likely locations based on favorable interstitial volumes and previous neutron diffraction results for similarly disordered Na2B10H10. 9,21 Moreover, multiple distinct B/C and H positions are only meant to mimic the average, spherically isotropic, anion orientational disorder present in these materials.

Na2B10H10, and one of the high-temperature polymorphs of Na2B12H12, 6,9 and provide a network of ample interstitial space with relatively more cation vacancies than Li2B12H12 and Na2B12H12 for facile cation transport. Although we observe only fcc structures at these temperatures, additional XRPD measurements indicate the gradual competing appearance of other similar-energy (and clearly similarly conductive) disordered polymorphs for NaCB11H12 at longer times and/or at higher temperatures (see Fig. S2 in the ESI † ), which is not uncommon. 6 It is possible that LiCB11H12 also possesses different polymorphs at higher temperatures above 430 K.

Preliminary QENS measurements for both LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 confirm the orders of magnitude leaps in anion orientational mobilities to between 10 10 and 10 11 reorientational jumps s /C0 1 in the disordered phases, as reflected in Fig. 6 by the transformation from purely resolution-limited elastic component peaks at 200 K to ones with significant quasielastic broadening at 433 K and 375 K, respectively. For both materials, the observed fraction of scattering that is quasielastic above Q = 1 Å /C0 1 appears to be of the order of 0.8 or more, suggesting that we are observing anion small-angle-jump reorientations akin to that observed for Na2B12H12, 24 which is thought to entail a distribution of individual anion motions ranging from one-axis to multi-axis

( N.B. , lower instrumental resolution was used for LiCB11H12, as detailed in the Experimental section.)

reorientations. A comparison of a simple one-Lorentzian fit of the broad component for NaCB11H12 in Fig. 6b to that for Na2B10H10 under identical conditions of temperature, Q , and instrumental resolution suggests that reorientational jump frequencies for the CB11H12 /C0 anions may be on the order of 60% higher than those for the B10H10 2 /C0 anions. 9 ( N.B. , Na2B12H12 is not normally in its disordered phase at 375 K and is therefore less straightforward to compare.) Of course, this comparison assumes similar reorientational mechanisms and ignores the reality that the mechanism-dependent broadening for these highly disordered anions is actually comprised of more than one Lorentzian component. 24 A more rigorous comparison and analysis confirming our observations awaits further QENS measurements using 11 B-enriched materials in combination with parallel NMR studies. If these higher relative CB11H12 /C0 orientational mobilities compared to the analogous B10H10 2 /C0 (and B12H12 2 /C0 ) anions are indeed the case, they are likely a consequence of relatively weaker cation-anion (coulombic)

interactions as well as, on average, one-half fewer near-neighbor cations for the CB11H12 /C0 anion.

Fig. 7 summarizes the conductivity-related results for both compounds. The ac impedance spectra of the symmetric cells for the LiCB11H12 and the NaCB11H12 electrolytes are characteristic of pure ionic conductors. ( N.B. , characteristic of all these disordered polyhedral-anion-based compounds, the anions can be considered translationally immobile compared to the rapidly diffusing cations. 7,9 Moreover, additional dc conductivity measurements indicate that electronic conduction is also relatively negligible, confirming near-unity cation transport numbers.) As shown in Fig. 7a, the Li-symmetric cell for LiCB11H12 had a parallel circuit of a resistor and a capacitor (semi-circle) at T r 393 K while only ohmic resistance appeared at T Z 403 K. On the other hand, a spike appeared after the semi-circle or ohmic resistance when using a Au-symmetric cell with this electrolyte (Au-symmetric cell data not shown) as well as with the NaCB11H12 electrolyte (Fig. 7b) owing to interface resistance. Thus, the semi-circle and ohmic

resistance appearing in the complex plane could be assigned to the total electrolyte resistances contributed by the bulk and grain boundaries. At elevated temperatures, conductivity jumps appeared for both materials accompanied by the order-disorder transition completed at 393 K to 403 K for LiCB11H12 and 373 K to 383 K for NaCB11H12. s Li+ for LiCB11H12 and s Na+ for NaCB11H12 are Z 0.15 S cm /C0 1 at T Z 403 K and Z 0.12 S cm /C0 1 at T Z 383 K, respectively, with low activation energies of 0.22 eV. The high-temperature ionic conductivities are the greatest among polycrystalline electrolytes investigated thus far, complex hydrides (Fig. 7c) or otherwise (Fig. 7d). Indeed, Li + conductivity for LiCB11H12 appears to surpass even that of the best known material, Li10GeP2S12 (which has a similar activation energy of 0.25 eV, Fig. 7d). 39 Na + conductivity for NaCB11H12 is even more impressive, being an order of magnitude higher than that of its closest competitor, Na2B10H10, 9 and almost 50 /C2 better (at 363 K) than the best Na3PS4-based glass ceramic. 14,40

It should be noted that the intermediate conductivities observed between around 323 K and the higher-temperature transitions for both compounds in Fig. 7c upon temperature cycling are likely due to the premature formation or lingering of some superionic disordered material, as evidenced by parallel XRPD measurements during similar temperature-cycling algorithms. Such idiosyncrasies in the phase behaviors of the polyhedral borates are known to be sensitive to the particular morphological details of the materials. 6,8,9

The order-of-magnitude higher Na + conductivity for NaCB11H12 (and LiCB11H12) compared to Na2B10H10, despite the similar hightemperature structures, is quite striking, leading one to reasonably speculate on the origins of such differences. Indeed, differences in anion charges, anion orientational mobilities, the number of cation vacancies, and lattice constants all might contribute to more favorable conductivities for the present compounds. In particular, the halved (monovalent) anion charge might lead to a decreased barrier for cation jumps through the anion sublattice due to decreased coulombic interactions. A relatively weaker Li + -anion interaction is indeed suggested for the CB11H12 /C0 anion from comparative mass spectrometry results and cluster calculations for both Li2B12H12 and LiCB11H12 moieties. 48,49 Also, the 1 : 1 cation : anion ratio means that there are relatively half as many cations in the LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 structures and therefore more available cation vacancies per unit cell. This would diminish the effects of possible cation-site blocking that might hinder cation transport. Moreover, the potentially more orientationally mobile CB11H12 /C0 anions might further assist cation transport by acting as better ''lubricants'' or cooperative (barrierlowering) partners as cations attempt to move past them. 8,24 Lastly, even though the CB11H12 /C0 and B10H10 2 /C0 anions are of similar size, the fcc lattice constant for NaCB11H12 at 356 K is already over 2% larger than that for Na2B10H10 at 410 K, 21 possibly providing a little more space for cation transport. As a result of all these factors, the Li + and Na + cations more rapidly migrate through the vacancy-rich three-dimensional sublattices of the high-symmetry cubic crystal structures that prevail in these materials. Hence, Both LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 exhibit liquidlike high ionic conductivities, as in the classical silver superionic

conductor, a -AgI ( s Ag+ Z 1.3 S cm /C0 1 at T Z 420 K). 50,51 A clearer understanding of the roles and importance of these various factors on the ultimate conductivity attainable in the superionic phases of this general class of compounds still awaits a thorough theoretical analysis of the different solid-state disordered systems accompanied by more experimental studies.

As a representative test of electrochemical stability, LiCB11H12 was incorporated into a positive electrode layer comprised of a hand-mixed TiS2/LiCB11H12 powder in a 1:1 mass ratio. This positive electrode layer was part of a bulk-type, all-solid-state TiS2/LiCB11H12|LiCB11H12|Li battery with LiCB11H12 acting as the electrolyte separator. This cell was operated repeatedly at 403 K and 0.2 C. It had approximately 175 mAh g /C0 1 discharge capacity during operation with approximately 95% coulombic efficiency (ratio of discharge to charge capacities) after the 3rd cycle. Fig. 8 illustrates discharge-charge profiles over five cycles, which suggest that the LiCB11H12 is reasonably stable with respect to TiS2 and Li over this voltage range. We consider this first rudimentary attempt to incorporate LiCB11H12 into a working battery as promising. As with all other new solid electrolyte materials, clearly many more electrochemical studies are warranted and need to be done to determine the optimal battery chemistries, configurations, and cycling conditions that can take full advantage of these polyhedral-anion-based salts, which is beyond the scope of this paper. Nonetheless, these preliminary results suggest that, besides their impressive conductivities, this class of complex hydrides comprised of highly stable aromatic-like 52 polyhedral anions, including B12H12 2 /C0 , B10H10 2 /C0 , and CB11H12 /C0 , has the potential for good electrochemical compatibility with commercial cathode materials, which will be critical for any eventual use in next generation, all-solid-state batteries.

## Conclusions

This work shows that LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 undergo orderdisorder phase transitions near 400 K and 380 K, respectively, which are substantially lower than those for the analogous Li2B12H12 and Na2B12H12 compounds. Above these transition temperatures, the cation-vacancy-rich, disordered phases for both compounds with their unusually high anion orientational mobility exhibit

unparalleled superionic Li + and Na + conductivities compared to the values reported for all other known solid polycrystalline Li + and Na + conducting materials.

Concerning other ongoing tangential studies, we have found that the stability range of the disordered phases for the broad class of polyhedral borate materials including the present materials can potentially be extended to lower temperatures via ball-milling, the details of which will be the subject of a separate publication. These morphological modifications can lead to dramatically improved bulk conductivities down to room temperature and below. Hence, the room-temperature conductivities of ball-milled LiCB11H12 and NaCB11H12 compounds have the potential to benefit significantly from the presence of such stabilized phases, and experiments are currently underway to explore this further.

Based on our current and past findings and the potential for further improvements via an assortment of possible additional morphological, chemical, or substitutional modifications, we believe that there are a large variety of intriguing new compounds and hybrid materials involving such large polyhedral anions still to be explored, and we anticipate that an optimized electrolyte from this class of materials will be considered one of the more promising for use in future, all-solid-state, energy conversion and storage devices.
