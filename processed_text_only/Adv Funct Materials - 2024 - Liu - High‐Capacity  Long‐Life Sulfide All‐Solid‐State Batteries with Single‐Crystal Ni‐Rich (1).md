Sulfide all-solid-state battery (SASSB) with ultrahigh-nickel layered oxide cathode (LiNi x Co y Mn1-x-y O2 , NCM, x ≥ 0.9) o/uniFB00ers the potential of high energy density and safety for superior energy storage systems. However, stable cycling is di/uniFB03cult to realize due to adverse interfacial reactions, space charge layer (SCL), and elemental di/uniFB00usion. Herein, a straightforward solid-phase coating strategy is exploited to synthesize Ni90-S cathode, which greatly improves the charge transmission capability of the composite cathode and suppresses interfacial reactions in SASSB. The consequent SC-Ni900.2%S/Li 6 PS 5 Cl/Li 4 Ti 5 O12 SASSB exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance, including a long life of 500 cycles with 87% capacity retention at 1C, high areal capacity of 11.44 mAh cm -2 , and excellent rate performance at 20 C. These results promise an e/uniFB03cient strategy for designing cathode materials for SASSBs.

electric vehicles, and large-scale energy storage fields. [ 1-4] However, the flammable organic liquid electrolytes used in commercial lithium-ion batteries will lead to thermal runaway, fires, and explosions during short circuits or overcharging, posing significant safety risks. [ 5-8] All-solidstate batteries (ASSBs) utilizing solid electrolytes (SEs) and ideally lithium-metal anode, which boasts an ultra-high theoretical capacity (3862 mAh g -1 ) and extremely low electrochemical potential, holding the promise of satisfying the growing demand for energy storage systems with superior safety and high energy density. [ 9-13] Within the realm of SEs, sulfides exhibit high room-temperature ionic conductivity (10 -3 10 -2 S cm -1 ) close to liquid electrolytes (LEs) and a pliable nature, rendering them highly promising for the future. [14-19] Meanwhile, in pursuit of high-energy-density ASSBs, significant attention has been directed towards ultrahigh-nickel layered oxide cathode (LiNi x Coy Mn1-x-y O2, NCM, x ≥ 0.9), owing to their high capacity, elevated platform voltage, and cost-e/uniFB00ectiveness. [ 20,21] Nonetheless, the high reactivity of sulfide SEs upon direct contact with oxide cathodes triggers chemical/electrochemical side reactions, consequently impeding the capacity of ultrahigh-nickel layered oxide cathode materials. [ 22,23]

Therefore, it is essential to establish a stable chemical/electrochemical interface between Ni-rich cathodes and sulfide SEs. Significant e/uniFB00orts have been devoted to this direction. [ 24-26] For instance, results show that applying surface coating layer onto NCM cathode by atomic layer deposition (ALD) can enhance rate performance, suppress severe side reactions on cathode/sulfide SE interface, and improve cycle life of sulfide ASSBs. [27] Despite the enhanced mechanical stability and extended cycle life of ALD coating, its high cost poses challenges for industrial-scale production. Therefore, choosing an economically applicable and e/uniFB00ective coating method assumes paramount importance. Moreover, replacing polycrystalline materials with single-crystal materials to eliminate intraparticle grain boundaries has demonstrated potential for upgrading the electrochemical performance of ASSBs. [25,28] Conventional poly-crystalline (PC) secondary NCM particles are made up of sub-micrometer primary grains with random orientations, leading to enriched Li + di/uniFB00usion paths and uneven Li concentration inside the particles for stress/strain concentration and ultimate internal cracking along grain boundaries. In the long-term oxidation-reduction process of sulfide ASSBs, surface side reactions, cracking, and

contact loss caused by volume changes will lead to structural collapse of the material and significant degradation of electrochemical performance, which becomes more severe as the Ni content increases. [ 29] Compared to polycrystal, single-crystalline (SC) NCM cathode with a more complete structure, smaller surface area, and no interparticle boundaries has attracted much attention. [ 30,31]

In this work, we employed a sulfide surface coating on singlecrystalline Li[Ni 0.9 Co0.05 Mn0.05 ]O 2 (SC-Ni90) to enhance the stability of SC-Ni90/sulfide SE interface. A low-temperature solidphase sulfur coating strategy is adopted to generate this sulfide surface coating layer to e/uniFB00ectively inhibit adverse reactions between sulfide SEs and oxide cathode, suppressing further decomposition of SEs, and proficiently alleviating the space charge layer e/uniFB00ect. Concurrently, the coating layer o/uniFB00ers an improved pathway for ion transportation, expediting lithium-ion di/uniFB00usions and mitigating impedance growth during cycling. Electrochemical performance indicates that SC-Ni90-0.2%S/Li 6 PS5 Cl/Li 4 Ti 5 O12 SASSB exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, including a long life of 500 cycles with 87% capacity retention at 1 C, a high areal capacity of 11.44 mAh cm -2 and an extremely high current rate of 20 C. The strategy adopted in this study provides valuable insight into the design of Ni-rich cathode materials for future reference of high-energy-density sulfide ASSBs.

## 2. Results and Discussion

## 2.1. Materials Characterization

Figure 1 a shows the X-ray di/uniFB00raction (XRD) patterns of SCNi90 and SC-Ni90-S samples. The main di/uniFB00raction peaks of

Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024 , 34 , 2315701

three samples are evident in the XRD patterns, which are clearly assigned to the hexagonal layered /u1D6FC -NaFeO2 structure and R-3m space group (JCPDS No. 70-4314), [32,33] indicating no damage caused by the coating process on the bulk crystal structure of SC-Ni90-S powder. The clear splitting of the (006)/(012) and (108)/(110) doublets in Figure 1b,c confirm an orderly arranged layered structure of SC-Ni90-S. [34-36] In addition, all c/a values of three materials calculated based on XRD patterns are higher than 4.9 (Table S1, Supporting Information), again corroborating the well-ordered layered structure. [ 37] However, as shown in Figure 1d, the characteristic peak (003) shifts to lower angles with the increased sulfide coating amounts, possibly attributable to the di/uniFB00usion of a small amount of sulfur to the surface lattice during sintering. This results in a slight expansion of crystal lattice due to the larger ionic radius of S 2(1.70 Å) than that of O 2(1.26 Å). [ 38]

To further investigate the e/uniFB00ect of coating strategy on the surface, SC-Ni90 and SC-Ni90-0.2%S samples were studied with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyses of HRTEM images were obtained using Digital Micrograph software ( Figure 2 d,m) to simulate di/uniFB00raction patterns and help identify the orientations of crystal planes. As shown in Figure 2a, the TEM image with low magnification presents the smooth surfaces of SC-Ni90 samples. HRTEM images reveal that the interplanar spacing of SCNi90 in the white-square region is 0.235 nm, corresponding well to the (012) crystal planes of SC-Ni90 in Figure 2b-d and Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Meanwhile, Figure 2k shows a 10-20 nm thick sulfide layer on the SC-Ni90-0.2%S particle surface, which has an obviously di/uniFB00erent structure from the

bulk crystalline region. The measured interplanar spacing of SCNi90-0.2%S is about 0.204 nm, corresponding well to the (104) crystal plane of SC-Ni90 in Figure 2k-m and Figure S2 (Supporting Information). Combining these findings with the XRD results in Figure 1, it can be concluded that SC-Ni90 with a sulfide coating layer was successfully synthesized. The sulfide layer prevents the electrode material from coming into direct contact with sulfide SE and thus suppresses interfacial side reactions. Moreover, to determine the uniformity of the coating layer, the surface of the 0.2 wt% S-coated SCNi90 powder was analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Figure 2n-s and Tables S2-S3 (Supporting Information) present an elemental map of the S-coated powder. S distributed uniformly on the surface of the SC-Ni90 powder, indicating that the sulfide coating layer was well dispersed on the surface.

## 2.2. Sulfide All-Solid-State Li-Ion Battery Performances

To investigate the e/uniFB00ect of sulfidation coating on the electrochemical performance of SC-Ni90 in sulfide ASSBs, a series of electrochemical tests were conducted. Figure 3 a-c respectively shows the charge and discharge curves of the three cathodes at di/uniFB00erent rates from 0.1 C to 20 C (all selected from the 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, 23rd, 28th, 33rd, and 38th cycles). The disparity in discharge capacities among the three cathodes is not pronounced when operating at a low current density of 0.1 C. However, as the current density increases, the distinction becomes progressively more noticeable. For instance, the discharge capacities of SCNi90, SC-Ni90-0.2%S, and SC-Ni90-0.5%S at the 23rd cycle (2 C) are 109.5, 137.2, and 126.8 mAh g -1 , respectively. The discharge capacities of SC-Ni90, SC-Ni90-0.2%S, and SC-Ni90-0.5%S at the 33rd cycle (10 C) are 51.2, 71.3, and 57.7 mAh g -1 , respectively.

The lower discharge capacity of SC-Ni90 at high current density is attributed to the high interfacial resistance caused by the interfacial side reactions between sulfide SE and oxide cathodes. On one hand, due to the thermodynamically unstable state of sulfide SE in the cathode potential range, direct contact between sulfide SE and oxide cathode leads to the formation of a lithiumdeficient space charge layer. On the other hand, due to the direct contact between sulfide SE and oxide cathode, the di/uniFB00used transition metal ions in sulfide solid electrolyte (S and P) may trigger secondary reactions between sulfide and oxide ions, also forming an undesirable reaction layer. [ 39-41] However, the sulfide-coating strategy not only suppresses undesirable reactions between sulfide SE and oxide cathode, but also e/uniFB00ectively alleviates the space charge layer e/uniFB00ect. Meanwhile, the coating layer provides an improved ion transfer channel that can accelerate the di/uniFB00usion of Li ions and promote reaction kinetics. Therefore, the capacity of SC-Ni90-0.2%S is significantly higher than that of other cathodes at an extremely high current density. Figure 3d shows the rate performance diagrams of the three cathodes, which obey the following law: SC-Ni90-0.2%S &gt; SC-Ni90-0.5%S &gt; SC-Ni90. This again indicates that the appropriate thickness of the coating layer is beneficial for improving rate performance of SC-Ni90. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) results for SC-Ni90/LPSC/LTO and SC-Ni90S/LPSC/LTO cells at a scan rate of 0.05 mV s -1 between 1.3 and 2.8 V (vs LTO) are presented in Figure 3e. Three anodic peaks and the corresponding cathodic peaks of each curve can be observed. The CV curves show that the anodic peak of SC-Ni90-0.2%S, corresponding to H1-M phase transformations at 2.12 V (vs LTO), shifts to a lower voltage compared to SC-Ni90. This shift indicates a reduction in polarization during the initial charging phase

Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024 , 34 , 2315701

and the improvement of the H1-M phase transformation. [42] This phenomenon can be attributed to the elevated lithium di/uniFB00usion coe/uniFB03cient of SC-Ni90-0.2%S (as demonstrated in Figure 6). The cyclic performance of the three materials was further evaluated at 0.3 C (Figure 3f). As shown in Figure 3f, after two cycles of activation, the discharge capacity of the pristine sample was ≈ 170 mAh g -1 , whereas those of SC-Ni90-0.2%S and SC-Ni90-0.5%S increased considerably to ≈ 187 and ≈ 183 mAh g -1 . Notably, after 100 cycles, the capacity of SC-Ni90-0.2%S ASSB has the smallest capacity attenuation, demonstrating improved interfacial stability between SC-Ni90-0.2%S and LPSC during the electrochemical processes. This e/uniFB00ect can be attributed to the stabilized cathode/sulfide interface by surface coating.

To investigate the electrochemical performance of the three cathodes at higher current density, after two cycles of activation at 0.1 C, the long cycling performance of the above cathodes was tested at 1 C. Figure 4a-c shows the charge-discharge curves of the three cathodes, respectively. Although the chargedischarge specific capacities are reduced compared with those at 0.1 C due to the increase in current density, the shapes and changing trends of the charge-discharge curves are very similar in Figure 4a-c. It is worth noting that compared with the other two cathodes, the smallest capacity attenuation range of SC-Ni90-0.2%S cathode can be obviously observed after 500 cycles within the same horizontal coordinate range. Furthermore, the pristine SC-Ni90 electrode shows a larger polarization voltage at the 500 th cycle compared to the 3 rd cycle (Figure 4a), while no obvious polarization voltage is observed at the 500 th cycle for the SC-Ni90-0.2%S electrode. This improved cyclic stability results from the enhanced interfacial stability between SC-Ni90-0.2%S

Figure 4. a-c) Charge/discharge profiles of SC-Ni90 and SC-Ni90-S in Sulfide ASSBs at various cycles. d) Long cycling performance of SC-Ni90 and SC-Ni90-S in Sulfide ASSBs at 1 C. e-g) Nyquist plots of SC-Ni90 and SC-Ni90-S in Sulfide ASSBs at various cycles.

cathode and sulfide SE through the surface coating strategy. As shown in Figure 4d, the initial discharge capacities of pristine SC-Ni90, SC-Ni90-0.2%S, and SC-Ni90-0.5%S cathodes at 1 C are 137.4, 172.8, and 153.4 mAh g -1 , respectively. Notably, an obvious increase in capacity is achieved even with these small coating amounts of 0.2 and 0.5 wt%. In addition, the cyclic properties of the three cathodes show the following pattern: SC-Ni90-0.2%S &gt; SC-Ni90-0.5%S &gt; SC-Ni90. Specifically, SC-Ni90 cathode has obvious capacity decay with 68.3% capacity retention. In comparison, SC-Ni90-0.2%S cathode displays not only an improved capacity of 172.8 mAh g -1 but also an enhanced capacity retention of 86.9% after 500 cycles. This corroborates again that the sulfide surface coating strategy can e/uniFB00ectively improve the electrochemical performance of SC-Ni90 in sulfide ASSBs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results obtained at the 3 rd , 200 th , and 400 th charge cycles for these cathodes are depicted in Figure 4e-g. The semicircular shapes in the plots denote the charge transfer resistance, primarily stemming from the interfacial resistance between SC-Ni90 cathodes and sulfide SE. As shown in Figure 4e-g, the interfacial impedance of pristine SCNi90 cathode exhibits a substantial increase from the 3 rd to the 400 th cycle. In contrast, SC-Ni90-0.2%S cathode displays the lowest interfacial impedance, while the interfacial impedance of SCNi90-0.5%S cathode is moderate after the 3 rd , 200 th , and 400 th cycles. This disparity arises because an appropriately thick coating layer can notably ameliorate the cathode-sulfide SE interfacial reactions, thereby enhancing cycling stability. However, the substantial thickness of the coating layer on SC-Ni90-0.5%S hinders the e/uniFB03cient transmission of Li ions during extended cycles, thereby diminishing cycle stability.

The SC-Ni90-S cathode can enable not only superior rate performance and ultra-high current density but also high proportions and loadings of cathode active materials (CAMs). As shown in Figure 5 , various ASSBs with di/uniFB00erent mass loadings of the

cathode active materials were assembled. The charge-discharge tests are performed at 55 ° C in the voltage range of 1.3-2.8 V (vs LTO). Figure. 5a-c shows the charge-discharge curves of the three cathodes with di/uniFB00erent mass loadings. It can be clearly observed that as the mass loading increases, the discharge capacity decreases. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 5d-f, pristine SCNi90, SC-Ni90-0.2%S, and SC-Ni90-0.5%S exhibit areal capacities of 9.46, 11.44, and 10.58 mAh cm -2 at the mass loading of 63.67 mg cm -2 , respectively. It is worth noting that when the mass loading reaches 63.67 mg cm -2 , the SC-Ni90-0.2%S ASSB shows the highest average discharge capacity of 172.8 mAh g -1 , compared with 165.7 and 148.4 mAh g -1 for SC-Ni90-0.5%S and pristine SC-Ni90 (in Figure 5g,h). Therefore, the sulfide coating technique and the obtained SC-Ni90-0.2%S reported in this work have a great commercial application promise for ASSBs with high areal capacity.

Figure 6 a-c shows CV tests at di/uniFB00erent scan rates to explain the di/uniFB00erences in the rate performance and long-cycling performance of di/uniFB00erent cathodes. It can be seen that the peak current of the redox peaks increased continuously as the scan rate increased, and the position of the oxidation/reduction peak shifted to a higher/lower potential gradually, which is consistent with the phenomenon that the polarization voltage increased with the increase of the current density. As is evident from the profiles, SC-Ni90-0.2%S gives rise to the smallest phase transformation (H1-M) potential gap at di/uniFB00erent scan rates from 0.05 to 0.4 mV s -1 , thereby indicating minor polarization. The di/uniFB00erent peak currents can be obtained by changing the scan rate, and the di/uniFB00usion coe/uniFB03cient can be obtained by the Randles-Sevcik equation [43,44]

Figure 4d shows the linear relationship between peak current (i p ) and the square root of scan rate (v 1/2 ). The slope of the fitted line of SC-Ni90-S is larger than that of

pristine SC-Ni90, indicating a larger di/uniFB00usion coe/uniFB03cient for Li ions after sulfidation coating. This is because a stable interface is constructed between SC-Ni90 cathode and sulfide SE, thereby promoting ion migration. Moreover, the slope of the fitted line of SC-Ni90-0.5%S is smaller than that of SC-Ni90-0.2%S, indicating that the thick coating layer hinders the transmission of Li ions and reduces the di/uniFB00usion coe/uniFB03cient of Li ions.

## 3. Conclusion

In summary, the sulfurization coating method can significantly improve the charge transmission capability of the composite cathode and suppress interfacial side reactions between SC-Ni90 cathode and sulfide SE. The SC-Ni90-0.2%S presents improved electrochemical performance, including a long life of 500 cycles with 87% capacity retention at 1 C, a high areal capacity of 11.44 mAh cm -2 , and an extremely high current density of 20 C. The strategy adopted in this study provides valuable insight into the design of high-energy-density cathode materials for sulfide ASSBs and may serve as future guidelines in this field.

## 4. Experimental Section

Cathode Materials Preparation : The cathode materials, singlecrystalline Li[Ni 0.9 Co 0.05 Mn0.05 ]O 2 (SC-Ni90), were combined with sulfur powder and ground for about half an hour to one hour at room temperature. Subsequently, the well-mixed composite was placed in an alumina crucible and transferred to a tube furnace. The mixture was heated at 150 ° C in a nitrogen atmosphere for 6 h to synthesize SC-Ni90-S powder.

Finally, after cooling to RT, the SC-Ni90-S material was obtained and prepared for further use by grinding.

Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Synthesis : The synthesis of Li 6 PS 5 Cl involved accurately weighing a specific amount of LiCl (Sigma Aldrich; &gt; 99%), P 2 S 5 (MACKLIN; 99%), and Li 2 S (Sigma Aldrich; &gt; 99%) according to the stoichiometry. These components were then placed in a zirconia jar and ballmilling for 50 h at 300 rpm. The resulting mixture was then thoroughly ground using a pestle, shaped into pellets, and sealed in a glass tube. Subsequently, the pellets underwent annealing at 550 ° C for 10 h. Figure S3 (Supporting Information) shows the Nyquist plot of Li 6 PS 5 Cl solid electrolyte (80 mg) without attaching the battery electrodes. The Li 6 PS 5 Cl solid electrolyte shows a small impedance of 14.5 Ω . Meanwhile, the thickness of the electrolyte layer was measured to be 0.05 cm, and the calculated RT ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is 4.4 mS cm -1 .

Materials Characterization : The XRD measurement was carried out utilizing the XD2 instrument from Beijing Purkinje, equipped with a copper radiator (1.54 Å). The operating voltage was set at 36 kV with a current of 20 mA. The scan rate employed was 4 ° per minute.

The TEM analysis was performed employing the transmission electron microscope (JEM-F200) with an acceleration voltage of 800 kV. TEM images were collected in HR-TEM mode, and EDS images were acquired in STEM mode.

ASSBs Assembly and Electrochemical Testing : According to a weight ratio of 50:45:5, SC-Ni90 material, Li 6 PS 5 Cl, and vertically grown carbon fiber (VGCF) were individually weighed and mixed by grinding for 1 h to prepare the composite cathode material. Similarly, based on a weight ratio of 50:40:10, Li 4 Ti 5 O12 , Li 6 PS 5 Cl, and VGCF were separately weighed and mixed by grinding for one hour to prepare the composite anode material.

All assembly work was done within a dry glove box, filled with argon. Stacked pellet cells were crafted using a custom mold. The pellet assembly took place inside the cell mold ( ϕ 10 mm). Initially, a dense Li 6 PS 5 Cl solid electrolyte layer was formed by compressing 80 mg of the Li 6 PS 5 Cl solid electrolyte under 250 MPa. Subsequently, 5 mg of the composite cathode material and 10 mg of the anode composite powder were evenly

www.advancedsciencenews.com distributed on both sides of the Li 6 PS 5 Cl solid electrolyte layer, followed by pressing at 1000 MPa for 2 min.

The Electrochemical measurements involved subjecting the assembled SASSBs to galvanostatic charge/discharge tests at 55 ° C, utilizing the standard cell testing instrument (LAND CT-2001A). The measurements were conducted within the voltage range of 1.3 to 2.8 V (vs LTO), and the nominal specific capacity is 200 mAh g -1 .

The CV measurements were performed on the electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) with a scan rate of 0.05 to 0.4 mV s -1 . The EIS measurements were also conducted on an electrochemical workstation (Zennium Pro). Before EIS measurements, ASSLBs were charged to 2.8 V (vs LTO), and the frequency range covered 8 MHz-100 mHz.
