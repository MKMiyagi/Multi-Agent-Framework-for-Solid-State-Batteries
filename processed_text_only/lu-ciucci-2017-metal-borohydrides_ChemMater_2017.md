ABSTRACT: Metal borohydrides are a family of materials that were recently discovered to have extraordinary ionic conductivities, making them promising candidates as electrolytes for solid-state batteries (SSBs). In fact, various groups have measured the ionic conductivities and assembled batteries using speci /uniFB01 c borohydrides. However, there are no comprehensive studies assessing the thermodynamic properties or discussing the suitability of metal borohydrides as electrolytes in SSBs, especially for beyond-lithium applications. In this work, we investigate the electrochemical stability, interfacial characteristics, mechanical properties, and ionic conductivities of Li, Na, Ca, and Mg borohydrides using /uniFB01 rst-principles calculations. Our results suggest that Li and Na borohydrides

are unstable at high voltages. However, the corresponding decomposition products, i.e., B 12H12 2 --containing phases, have wide electrochemical windows which protect the electrolyte, leading to large electrochemical windows as wide as 5 V. In addition, our simulations indicate that metal borohydrides are ductile, suggesting facile processing. However, their low shear moduli may result in metal dendrite formation. For Ca and Mg borohydrides, while they possess reasonably good electrochemical stability, the low cationic di /uniFB00 usivity may impede their practical use. Finally, the anion rotation barrier was shown to correlate with the superionic phase transition temperature, suggesting that anion mixing may be a potential approach to achieve room-temperature superionic conductivity.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are among the most promising energy storage devices that may replace lithium ion batteries (LIBs). 1 -6 This is because SSBs have, in principle, a higher energy density compared to LIBs. 3,7 Additionally, SSBs are intrinsically safer because the /uniFB02 ammable and volatile organic electrolytes of LIBs are replaced with relatively inert solids. 1,3,5 Although the chemistries of solid-state and organic electrolytes are quite di /uniFB00 erent, the basic requirements are similar; electrolytes need (1) to be electron insulating, (2) to have ionic conductivities large enough to enable high power output, (3) to be chemically compatible with electrode materials, and (4) to have an electrochemical window wide enough to cover the working potential of the battery. Many families of solid electrolytes (SEs) have been studied, including oxides, 8 -11 sul /uniFB01 des, 12 -15 hydrides, 16,17 halides, 18 -22 and phosphates, 23 -25 where each such family of materials has strengths and weaknesses. For example, sul /uniFB01 de-type Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) has an ionic conductivity comparable or even superior to that of organic liquid electrolytes. However, LGPS tends to be reduced by Li metal. 26,27 Oxide-type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO)-based materials are less conductive than LGPS, but their stability

against Li is superior than that of sul /uniFB01 des. 26 Hydride-type LiNH2 is mechanically /uniFB02 exible, allowing facile processing, and is stable against Li anodes, but it is poorly compatible with most cathodes. 16 Materials in the halide-type anti-perovskite family, such as Li 3 OCl, have good conductivity but are very sensitive to the synthesis conditions. 18,19,21,22 Finally, phosphates and borates, such as LiTi2(PO4)3 and Li3BO3, are usually characterized by a relatively low conductivity. 23 -25

Recently, metal borohydrides have drawn considerable research interest because of the high Na and Li conductivity. 28 -30 This family of materials has the composition M x B y H z , where M are either alkali (Li, Na, K, and Rb) or alkaline-earth (Mg, Ba, Ca, Sr and Ba) metals and B y H z are borohydride anions. In a typical metal borohydride crystal, these anions form a sca /uniFB00 old to hold the cations. Figure 1a shows several commonly found borohydride anions, including BH4 -, B6H6 2 -, B10H10 2 -, and B12H12 2 -. 17 For illustration purposes, we show the primitive cell of crystalline Li2B12H12 in Figure 1b,

where the B12H12 2 -anions constitute a face-centered cubic (FCC) framework and the Li + cations are accommodated within the spaces between the anions. 32

At low temperature, the anions are usually ordered. They vibrate around their nominal lattice site, leading to low cation di /uniFB00 usivity. 17 Instead, when the temperature increases, the anions rotate and their orientations are disordered, leading to both orientational anionic disorder and to superionic conduction. 17

Metal borohydrides were recognized as hydrogen storage materials as early as 1953 and have been widely investigated since. 33,17,34,35 In 2006, Nakamori et al. discovered that LiBH 4 has a Li conductivity as high as 10 -3 S cm -1 at 390 K. 36,37 Several groups have since tested LiBH4 in full batteries. 38 -40 Following these pioneering works, other metal borohydrides were investigated as SEs. In 2013, Buckley et al. and Teprovich et al. studied the phase transition and ion conduction in Li 2 B12 H12. 41,42 Udovic and co-workers substituted B12H12 2 -with other anions and obtained Li 2 B10 H10, LiCB11H12, and LiCB9H10. 30,43,29 These materials have an ionic conductivity as high as 0.03 S cm -1 at 354 K. 29 Interestingly, Na-conducting borohydrides (Na2B12H12, Na2B10H10, NaCB11H12, and NaCB9H10) exhibit even higher conductivities and, to the best of our knowledge, NaCB9H10 currently holds the record for the highest Na conductivity with 0.03 S cm -1 at 297 K. 28 -30 Despite the aforementioned achievements, no existing borohydride has a conductivity greater than 0.01 S cm -1 at RT. To achieve the desired RT conductivity, two approaches could be taken. One is to lower the phase transition temperature because it is known that borohydrides have high ionic conductivities in their disordered phase. Possible methods could be substituting the anionic groups with halides or by high intensity mechanical ball-milling. 44 -46 Another way of tackling the low RT conductivity problem is to enhance the intrinsic cation di /uniFB00 usivity, which is the product of two factors: (1) the concentration of charge carriers, which is related to the cation vacancy formation energy, and (2) the intrinsic jump rates of charge carriers, which is the cationic di /uniFB00 usion barrier. 47,48 Both have been used to improve the conductivity in borohydrides. For example, Takamura and co-workers increased the conductivity of LiBH4 by doping Ca on the Li site, which promotes the Li vacancy concentration. 49 Conversely, Remhof et al. reduced the Li migration barrier and enhanced the Li di /uniFB00 usion in LiBH4 by substituting BH 4 -anions with NH2 -. 50

Due to the fast ion transport in metal borohydrides, a number of groups have studied the structural properties and the mechanism of di /uniFB00 usion. The disorder phase transition was /uniFB01 rst correlated to superionic behavior for LiBH 4 by Orimo et al. 36,37 Later, Orimo et al. 51 carried out ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and explained the origin of fast Li conduction. They found that the fast Li di /uniFB00 usion is related to the atom occupation splitting, where the fully occupied Li sites split into two partially occupied sites above the phase transition temperature. In 2014, Buckley et al. found that the Li 2 B12 H12, a type of Li borohydride containing larger anions, also undergoes a similar phase transition. 41 Udovic and co-workers investigated the correlation between cation transport and the anion disorder using Na2B12H12 as a model material. 52 The same group carried out neutron powder di /uniFB00 raction and nuclear magnetic resonance on several Na-Li-based borohydrides and derived the structural and dynamical properties. 43,53,54 Despite these pioneering studies on the correlation between cationic di /uniFB00 usion and anionic rotations, many other properties need to be known. In particular, it is critical to assess the electrochemical stability and mechanical properties of these materials (i.e., bulk and shear moduli).

In this article, we present the chemical and electrochemical stability, the interfacial reactivity, and the mechanical strength of several Li, Na, Ca, and Mg conducting metal borohydrides. After introducing the computational methods and the materials systems, we discuss the computed compositional phase diagrams to assess the intrinsic thermodynamic and chemical stability (against metal anodes) of the materials studied. We also evaluated the electrochemical stability of metal borohydrides under applied potential based on the band structure and grand-potential phase diagrams. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanical characteristics of the metal borohydrides by calculating the elastic constants. The computed Pugh ratio, which is a descriptor for the ductility of a material, is used to infer its mechanical processability. 55,56 On the other hand, the shear modulus can be linked to the capability of the material to prevent the formation of dendrites. 57 Additionally, we attempted to assess the charge carrier concentration, a quantity directly relevant to the cationic conductivity, by calculating the cationic vacancy formation energies. Finally, since a low

superionic phase transition temperature is critical for the practical use of these material at room temperature, we correlated the DFT-calculated anion rotation barriers to experimental phase transition temperatures and provide strategies to lower the phase transition temperature, i.e., by making solid solutions using phases with di /uniFB00 erent anion sizes.

## 2. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD

## 2.1. Ground State Energies and Electronic Structures.

The ground state energies of some phases were already computed as part of the Materials Project (MP); 58 for this reason, we directly retrieved these values from the MP database. As it is described in the Material Systems and Crystal Structures section 2.2, we also considered other potential phases, for which we calculated the ground state energies using the same computational settings of the MP. All DFT calculations were done using VASP with the GGA-PBE functional. 59,60 All calculations were spin-polarized except for molecular dynamics simulations. 59,60 For the electron part, the energy cuto /uniFB00 for plane waves was set at 520 eV. To model the core electrons, we used the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method. 61 The Brillouin zone was sampled on a Monkhorst -Pack k -point mesh with a density of 1000/(number of atoms in the cell). 62 For the ionic relaxation, all degrees of freedom including the lattice parameters were allowed to change until the energies converged to 1 meV/atom. The computational scheme was further evaluated by relaxing the structure of LiBH 4 with several di /uniFB00 erent exchange correlation functionals, i.e., LDA, GGA-PBE, GGA-PBEsol, and GGA-PBE+D3. 63,64 The results are shown in Table S1. All calculations yielded lattice constants in reasonable agreement with the experimental results. We chose to use the GGA-PBE functional for consistency with the MP database.

The calculation of the density of states of the bulk systems was carried out using the MBJ meta-GGA functional (modi /uniFB01 ed Becke -Johnson exchange potential in combination with the LDA-correlation functional). 65,66 This method was chosen because it yields band gaps with an accuracy similar to those obtained using a hybrid functional or GW methods but with a computational cost comparable to that for semilocal DFT calculations. 66,67

2.2. Material Systems and Crystal Structures. We directly retrieved the relaxed structures and the corresponding energies of the phases that are already included in the MP database. We also considered other potential phases within the M-B-H (M = Li, Na, Ca, Mg) ternary composition range. In particular, we included all the phases with composition A x B n H n (A = Li, Na; x = 1, 2; n = 11, 12) and MB n H n (M = Ca, Mg; n = 11, 12) that were previously reported in the literature. 17 In order to search for low energy structures, we also considered cation-exchanged and anion-rotated polymorphs. For example, we substituted all of the Li atoms in the known Li 3 BH6 crystal to Na and included this entry when building the Na-B-H phase diagrams. Phases we added to the MP database in this calculation and their references are listed in part 1, section 1 of the Supporting Information (SI).

2.3. Phase Diagrams, Electrochemical Windows, and Vacancy Formation Energies. The compositional phase diagrams were constructed using the pymatgen code based on DFT ground state energies (0 K and 0 atm). 68,69 The detailed description of the algorithms used to construct the phase diagrams are described elsewhere. 70,71 The formation energies of all phases of interest were calculated based on DFT and normalized by the number of atoms in the formula. Using the normalized formation energies, we searched for the convex hulls in the compositional space. To read the phase diagram, one needs to specify the composition of interest and calculate its coordinate in the compositional space using the lever rule. Once the coordinate is located, one can determine whether it is a stable phase or a mixed phase. The stable phases are shown using the black dots, while the components of the mixed phases are given by the vertices of the triangle bounding that composition. For example, if one is interested in determining the phase of LiB10H9 (indicated as α in Figure 2a), one sees from the diagram that it is a mixture of B, B 9 H11, and Li 2 B12 H12.

Figure 2. Compositional phase diagrams of (a) Li-B-H, (b) Na-B-H, (c) Ca-B-H, and (d) Mg-B-H compositional phase diagrams. The calculated stable phases are indicated by the black dots with their compositions labeled with black fonts correspondingly. We also show possible metastable phases whose ground state energies are &lt;80 meV/ atom above the hull. These phases are indicated by the red squares. Due to space limitation, their compositions are not shown in the /uniFB01 gure but captioned here: ( α ) LiB10H9, ( β ) Li 2 B10 H10, ( γ ) LiB3H8, ( δ ) Na2B10H10, ( ε ) Na2B6H6, and ( ζ ) NaB3H8. The dashed line in (a) represents the LiBH4-Li compositional space. The red cross in (a) denotes the vacancy containing structure Li 7/8BH4 (or Li7B8H32).

In order to obtain the thermodynamics of the metal borohydrides open to a reservoir of the corresponding metal, we also constructed the grand-potential phase diagrams using the methodology of Ceder et al. 70 In these phase diagrams, the chemical potential μ M of M (M = Li, Na, Ca, and Mg) is given as a function of the electrode potential ϕ by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where μ M 0 is the electrochemical potential of M and ϕ is the applied potential referenced to M.

The electrochemical window of a speci /uniFB01 c phase was calculated by constructing the grand-potential phase diagram versus ϕ . The range of potentials ϕ within which the speci /uniFB01 c phase is stable (the phase is a vertex of the convex hull) is the electrochemical window of the phase. We should point out that the current approach does not take into account the kinetics e /uniFB00 ect. 72

The cation vacancy formation energies were estimated using two methods based on charge-neutral con /uniFB01 gurations. First,

similarly to the work of Miara et al., 73 we considered the phase equilibria using the calculated phase diagram. For example, for LiBH4, we created a vacancy containing structure with the composition Li7/8 BH4 (or Li7B8H32, where one vacant Li site is present in the structure). Then the coordination of this phase on the phase diagram was calculated using the lever rule and shown in Figure 2a using a red triangle. Since this structure is not on the convex hull, it will decompose into corresponding stable phases, i.e., BH 3 , LiBH4, and H2 (the three vertexes of the triangle covering Li 7/8 BH4). Therefore, the following reaction is obtained

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Δ E equilibrium is the reaction energy calculated based on phase equilibrium. The /uniFB01 nal vacancy formation energy was normalized by the number of Li atoms in the nondefective supercells, leading to Δ E vacancy -equilibrium = Δ E equilibrium /64 = 0.33 eV. Using this method, the BH4 -anion is predicted to decompose. This reaction may be kinetically slow at room temperature as explained in Electrochemical Stability section 3.2. Therefore, we also considered a second approach, where a Li cation is directly extracted from the materials (without the decomposition of anions) following the reaction:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This leads to a higher vacancy formation energy of E vacancy -extract = Δ E extract/8 = 0.59 eV, which is higher than the previous method. This is because the metal borohydrides are unstable with the reaction product, i.e., lithium metal based on later analysis.

- 2.4. Elastic Constants. To obtain the mechanical properties, we calculated the 6 × 6 elastic tensors ( Cij ) by enforcing six /uniFB01 nite distortions (0.01 Å) on the relaxed lattice and derived the elastic constants from the linear strain -stress relationship using VASP. 74 To estimate the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials, we used the Voigt (V) and Reuss (R) models to calculate the bulk ( B ) and shear ( G ) moduli. This procedure gave us upper and lower bounds. 75 Details are presented in the part 2, section 1 of the SI. We also calculated the Voigt -Reuss -Hill (VRH) modulus by averaging the Voigt and Reuss models. 76 The Pugh ratio was determined by dividing the bulk ( B ) and shear ( G ) moduli under the Voigt -Reuss -Hill limit. In all elastic property calculations, we used higher energy cuto /uniFB00 s of 700 eV and doubled the k -points on each direction compared with the ground state energy calculations.

2.5. Molecular Dynamics Simulations. We studied CaB12H12 and MgB12H12 using Born -Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at desired temperatures using a Nose -Hoover thermostat with a /uniFB01 xed simulation box size (NVT ensemble). 77 The supercells were constructed so that at least 8 cations are present in the simulation box. The time steps were chosen to be 1 fs. All electron self-consistent calculations were carried out using VASP with an energy cuto /uniFB00 of 350 eV and an energy convergence criterion of 10 -4 eV. The plane waves were sampled at the Γ point only.

## 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

- 3.1. Phase Stability. The phase stability of metal borohydrides was studied by constructing A-B-H (A = Li, Na, Ca, and Mg) ternary phase diagrams. For lithium, we found most of the phases reported in previous experimental work to

be either thermodynamically stable or thermodynamically metastable. As shown in Figure 2a, LiBH4 and Li2B12H12 lie on the convex hull, meaning that they are intrinsically stable. This is in agreement with the reports on the stability of the latter phase, where Li2B12H12 was con /uniFB01 rmed as an intermediate species during the hydrogen desorption of LiBH4 via in situ thermogravimetry, X-ray di /uniFB00 raction, and DFT calculations. 78,32,79 Several structures based on anion substitutions to Li 2B12H12 have also been recently reported. For example, Udovic et al. synthesized Li2B10H10 and analyzed its crystal structure using neutron powder di /uniFB00 raction. 43 Interestingly, from our calculations, Li2B10H10 is thermodynamically unstable at 0 K. As shown in Table S2, its energy is 53 meV/atom above the hull. Since this value is relatively small, such phase could be in principle stabilized by entropy at RT. Our results also suggest that other anion modi /uniFB01 cations may lead to metastable phases, such as LiB10H8 and LiB3H8, which have not been found experimentally. Apart from the intrinsic stability, the phase diagram also gives information on the chemical stability, i.e., the stability of a material when it is in contact with the corresponding metal anode. Generally, if there is no additional panel in the convex hull between two phases, those can coexist. As shown in Figure 2a, all of the calculated Li borohydrides are thermodynamically unstable with lithium metal. For example, LiBH4 tends to decompose into Li 2 B12 H12, LiH, and LiB depending on the Li -LiBH4 ratio. Such electrolyte -anode instability may be detrimental to a solid-state battery. Additionally, this /uniFB01 nding is in contrast with previous experimental results where Li borohydrides were found to be electrochemically stable with Li metal. 17,39,40,42 These results suggest that either the reactions are kinetically slow or that the interface is stabilized during the battery operation. This point will be discussed in the next section.

The phase stability of Na borohydrides is similar to that of Li borohydrides in spite of Na ' s larger ionic radius; see Figure 2b. In both cases (A = Li, Na), ABH4 and A2B12H12 are thermodynamically stable, while the substitutions of anions to others, such as B 10H10 2 -, leads to metastable phases. However, we should note that, although the phase diagrams share some resemblance, the crystal structures (cations/anions packing) are usually di /uniFB00 erent. For example, in Li 2 B12 H12, the anions are cubic close-packed (ccp)/faced-centered cubic (fcc), whereas, in the Na counterpart (Na2B12H12), they are hexagonal closepacked (hcp). Regarding the chemical stability, our calculations suggest that, in contrast with their Li counterparts, NaBH 4 and Na2B12H12 are stable against Na metal. Such stability might indicate that interfacial issues arise when assembling Na SSBs.

Figure 2c,d shows the ternary Ca-B-H and Mg-B-H phase diagrams. For Ca and Mg, we found considerably fewer metastable phases. This might be due to the lack of input structures despite that we collected, to the best of our knowledge, all known Ca and Mg borohydrides structures from the literature and tried to derive several potential structures from the Li and Na counterparts as shown in Figure S4 of the SI. For the considered cases, the BH 4 -- and B 12H12 2 --containing phases tend to be stable. Both CaBH4 and MgBH4 decompose into compounds containing B12H12 2 -when they are in contact with the metal anodes. Among all calculated Ca and Mg borohydrides, MgB12H12 is the only thermodynamically stable phase against its metal anode.

Interestingly, the phase diagrams also explain the thermodynamic origin of the experimentally observed anion disorder phase transitions. For many of the compositions studied,

various structures with identical phase diagram coordinates have very similar energies. An example is shown in the inset of Figure 2b, where, for the composition Na2B12H12 (denoted with the arrow), a single stable phase is observed. Additionally, we also identi /uniFB01 ed metastable phases with the same composition (denoted with the red square) which are &lt;80 meV/atom above the hull. In one of these structures, the ion arrangements are very close to the most stable ones but the B12H12 2 -anionic groups have slightly di /uniFB00 erent orientations; see Figure S4. This /uniFB01 nding supports the previous report on the anion disorder phase transitions in metal borohydride since such a small energy di /uniFB00 erence may imply that the metastable states are possible at /uniFB01 nite temperatures. According to Udovic et al., Na2B12H12 goes through an anion disorder phase transition at elevated temperatures accompanied by a signi /uniFB01 cant increase in Na conductivity. 52 Since the rotation of the B12H12 2 -groups does not lead to signi /uniFB01 cantly higher energies, such a process could be activated by thermal /uniFB02 uctuations. For MgB12H12 and CaB12H12, such phase transitions have not been reported experimentally. However, since we computed metastable phases for MgB12H12 and CaB12H12, we can speculate that, analogous with Li and Na borohydrides, a similar anion disordered phase transition may occur in MgB 12H12 and CaB12H12. We examined such hypothesis, using ab initio MD simulations, which showed that the B 12H12 2 -anions in CaB12H12 rotate at 1500 K but not at 1000 K. The corresponding trajectories are shown in Figure S3.

3.2. Electrochemical Stability. One critical requirement of an electrolyte is a wide electrochemical window, which allows the use of high-voltage cathodes. While a number of SEs, including LLZO and LGPS, have been reported to have wide electrochemical windows, 12,80 recent studies combining cyclic voltammetry and DFT calculations show that some of these materials are intrinsically unstable as high-voltage cathodes. 26 For example, LLZO reacts with the high-voltage LiMn 1.5 Ni0.5O4 and the battery stops after a short discharge. 26,81,82 This puts into question whether the novel metal borohydride-based SSB could be cycled at high voltages. We computationally address this issue in two ways: (1) we calculated the band structures of the metal borohydrides; (2) we constructed the grand-potential phase diagrams. With the former methods, we obtain an upper bound of the electrochemical stability window against corresponding inert electrodes, in contrast with the latter approach, for which a lower bound is obtained. 26,83

In the former method, the electrochemical window is interpreted as the voltage range within which the material is neither reduced nor oxidized. In principle, to oxidize a material, an electron needs to be removed from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or the valence band maximum (VBM). To reduce a material, an electron needs to be added to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or the conduction band minimum (CBM).

Thus, it is natural to correlate the electrochemical window of a material to its band gap, i.e., the gap between LUMO and HOMO. However, since it is nontrivial to reference the energy levels of di /uniFB00 erent materials based on periodic DFT calculations and no chemical contact with the electrode material is considered, the results of this method, i.e., the band gap, should be regarded as an upper bound of the intrinsic electrochemical window against inert electrodes. 83 The partial density of states of the metal borohydrides are shown in Figure 3. The band gaps of all materials exceed 5 eV based on metaGGA level calculations. This indicates a large electrochemical

All the energies are referenced to the corresponding Fermi level of the borohydrides. The VBMs and CBMs were denoted with dashed lines. For LiBH4, the working potential range of the 5 V Li | LiBH4 | cathode battery is shown as the shaded area. The Li/Li + level is absolute Li electrode potential, and the VBM of 5 V cathode (dotted line) is calculated by subtracting 5 eV from that. Detailed theory and computation method can be found in part 4, section 1 of the SI and also previous work. 84

window against inert electrodes. In all the calculated entries, the lowest occupied states are always dominated by the anion species. It means that the anionic groups are likely the /uniFB01 rst part of the electrolyte to be oxidized under high voltages. This is in agreement with the predicted reactions from the grandpotential phase diagram (Figure S6), where the BH4 -and B12H12 2 -anions are oxidized to B x H y species, e.g., B2H6 and B2H5, at high voltages. As mentioned above, the problem of this method is the alignment of band edges (determination of absolute energy of HOMO and LUMO). This could in general be solved by building a slab model and reference all energies to vacuum. 84 -86 However, due to the high computational cost of surface-type models, we only reformed this adjustments for LiBH4 (the implementative details are provided in part 4, section 1 of the SI). As shown in Figure 3, the Li/Li + level (Li Fermi level with respect to vacuum) and the 5 V cathode level (Li Fermi level -5 eV) are between HOMO (VBM) and LUMO (CBM) of LiBH4. This indicates that LiBH4 should be stable upon reduction of Li and should be compatible with high oxidative potentials. However, such result only provides a stability upper bound. In fact, the VBM of a high voltage 5 V cathode is very close to the VBM of LiBH 4 , meaning the LiBH4 might still be oxidized by the cathode and further analysis is required.

We then evaluated the electrochemical stability of the materials by constructing grand-potential phase diagrams. This method was previously applied to several oxide and sul /uniFB01 des, and some of the predictions were later veri /uniFB01 ed experimentally. 26,87 -89 Figure 4 summarizes the electrochemical windows computed using this method. For Li and Na, we predicted that the BH4 --containing phases are oxidized at ∼ 2 V vs Li/Li + (Na/Na + ). This is in contrast with the experimental cyclic voltammetry results suggesting their stability up to 5 V. 39 Since many works reported that the decomposition of LiBH4 is kinetically slow and the reaction only happens at elevated temperatures, 17 it is possible that our underestimated electro-

The red area indicates the electrochemical window calculated with the B x H y species included and the shaded area indicates the ones calculated without the B x H y species included. The experimental values were obtained from the work of Unemoto et al. 39 and the review by Mohtadi et al. 17

chemical window is due to the sluggish anion decomposition. 72,90,91 As mentioned previously, the electrochemical windows were estimated based solely on thermodynamics while such reactions might be so slow that the current could be hardly measured using CV at RT. 26,72,92 Following this, we analyzed the e /uniFB00 ect of discarding all B x H y phases, the products of the potential slow anion decomposition reactions, from the grand-potential phase diagrams (Figure 5a,b). 72,93 However, the electrochemical windows of LiBH4 and NaBH4 are still much narrower than those reported experimentally (see in Figure 4). This indicates the possibility of an alternative stabilization mechanism. Interestingly, we found that the decomposition products at high voltages are Li2B12H12 and Na2B12H12 (shown in Figure 5a,b and Figure S5), two materials that were recently found to be ionically conductive. 42,94 From Figure 4, the electrochemical windows of these two phases are much wider than those of their BH 4 --containing counterparts. On the basis of this, we propose the stabilization mechanism shown in Figure 5c. The electrolyte, e.g., LiBH4 and Li2B10 H10, initially reacts with the cathode material to form ionically conductive B12H12 2 --containing interphases. Due to the electrochemical stability of the interphases, this thin layer protects the electrolyte and prevents the cathode materials to be further consumed by the reaction. This is in agreement with recent experiments by Orimo et al., who suggested that Li2B12H12 forms between the cathode and the LiBH 4 electrolyte. 40 On the anode side, we predicted that both Li and Na borohydrides are likely to decompose to borides and hydrides at reductive potential (low voltages). A similar stabilization mechanism for the cathode | electrolyte interface may also apply to the anode side as shown in Figure 5c, where the electrolyte is protected by the binary compounds, such as LiB and LiH.

We want to note, however, that, due to the low reduction potential (&lt;0.25 V), the driving forces might be relatively small so such reaction might be slow or even hindered. We can draw some similarity with the LLZO | Li interface. On the basis of DFT calculations, Mo et al. reported that LLZO is also thermodynamically unstable against a Li anode. However, the reduction potential of LLZO (0.05 V) is close to that of Li deposition (0 V) with a correspondingly small thermodynamic force driving the reduction. 26 Therefore, it is not surprising that the LLZO | Li interface is found stable experimentally.

Recently, Ca and Mg batteries have received increased attention as alternatives to the lithium-based battery because of their high volumetric capacity and improved safety where no dendrites form. 95,96 Thus, the electrochemical windows of Mg

and Ca borohydrides were also evaluated. As shown in Figure 4, these phases exhibit similar stability compared to their Li/Na counterparts. At low potentials, they tend to be reduced by metallic anodes to form borides and hydrides. For Mg, the reduction potential is relatively low (&lt;0.5 eV), indicating a relatively small driving force for the reaction. This might be the reason for the recently identi /uniFB01 ed compatibility between the Mg anode and Mg(BH4)2/TMF electrolytes. 97 While we are not aware of any electrochemical experiments of Ca borohydrides, our calculations predict that the Ca borohydrides are severely reduced at the Ca anode with reaction energies of ( ∼ 3.868 eV/ f.u. for Ca(BH4)2). Experiments are however needed to assess the Ca | Ca borohydride interfacial problems. At high potentials, both Ca and Mg borohydrides possess relatively good stabilities against electrochemical oxidation. Considering the reactivity of conventional liquid Mg and Ca electrolytes with cathodes, a very thin layer of corresponding borohydrides may work as a protective coating layer for high-voltage (&gt;5 V) cathodes due to their electrochemical stability. 96

3.3. Mechanical Properties. One major advantage of SEs over their conventional organic counterparts is the ability to suppress metal dendrite growth thanks to the superior mechanical properties. While this statement holds true for most ceramic-type oxides, e.g., LLZO, 56 whether metal borohydrides are mechanically compatible with metal anodes is still an open question. Another critical property for solid-state electrolytes is their ductility. For example, oxide SSEs are known to be brittle and likely break during mechanical loading. Specialized techniques need to be developed to process such thin layers. 5 We addressed these issues using DFT calculations.

We calculated the shear moduli, bulk moduli, and the Pugh ratios of the stable and metastable Li/Na borohydrides under the Voigt -Reuss -Hill assumption; see Figure 6. Both the shear

Figure 6. Panels (a) and (b) shear moduli, panels (c) and (d) bulk moduli, and panels (e) and (f) Pugh ratios of Li/Na metal and metal borohydrides, respectively. The dotted lines in (a) and (b) indicate a doubled shear moduli of calculated Li and Na metal which indicates the lower limit which the electrolyte could resist dendrite formation.

and bulk moduli of metal borohydrides are relatively small compared with those of metal oxides (such as Fe2O3, whose bulk and shear moduli are on the order of several hundreds of GPa). 98 The weaker mechanical strength is probably due to the rotational /uniFB02 exibility of large anions during the loading process. The shear moduli of Li and Na borohydrides are on the same order of magnitude of the Li and Na anodes, respectively.

According to Monroe and Newman ' s work, which is based on linear elasticity, the shear modulus is related to the ability to resist metal dendrite formation; additionally, 56,57 the shear modulus of an electrolyte should be at least twice that of the lithium metal anode in order to prevent Li dendrite growth. 56,58 The computed modulus of Li2B12H12 is higher than that of LiBH4 and is approximately equal to twice that of Li. This result suggests that the formation of such interphase may further help suppress dendrites. However, we must note that linear elasticity only provides qualitative bounds. Actually, contrary to the LLZO oxide, whose shear modulus is orders of magnitude higher than that of Li, the shear moduli of metal borohydrides are relatively close to twice that of the corresponding anodes. Thus, whether they are capable to suppress the dendrite formation needs careful experiments. We also calculated the Pugh ratio, an indicator of material ductility, of the metal borohydrides (materials are usually classi /uniFB01 ed as ductile if the Pugh ratio is higher than 1.75 and brittle under 1.75). The values for Li borohydrides all exceed 1.75, indicating that they are likely ductile in nature. This is crucial for device level production which usually involves mechanical processing. 56 For Na, though some of the borohydrides could be classi /uniFB01 ed as brittle, their Pugh ratio is a little below 1.75. We should stress again that, while these results are encouraging because they suggest that mechanical processing is potentially facile, actual experimental validation is needed.

3.4. Implications on Disordered Phase Transition and Ionic Conductivity. A high enough ionic conductivity is one of the most critical requirements for SSEs. In metal borohydrides, it is known that the cation transport is closely linked to anion rotations. 17,29,52 -54,94 At low temperatures, the anions are arranged in an ordered manner and cation hopping is generally infrequent. At elevated temperatures, the anions can rotate and the rotational distortions are bene /uniFB01 cial to the cation di /uniFB00 usion. Previous studies found that the Li/Na conductivities are orders of magnitude higher in the high-temperature anion disordered phases. Thus, one of the major challenges is to lower this transition temperature. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether there is any correlation between the phase transition temperatures and other structural properties of metal borohydrides. We calculated the anion rotation barrier of anions in di /uniFB00 erent phases, and the values are shown in Figure 7a together with the experimentally observed phase transition temperatures. Despite the relatively small sample size, we found a positive correlation between the two variables (with Pearson correlation coe /uniFB03 cient of 0.81, which is an indication of positive linear relationship); i.e., a larger rotation barrier is associated with a higher phase transition temperature. This is in agreement with the previously observed thermally activated anion rotation process. 99,100 In addition, the rotation barrier appears to be negatively correlated with the anion size; e.g., the BH4 --containing phases have lower rotation barriers compared to other phases. Considering this, it might be interesting to see, experimentally, whether two metal borohydrides with di /uniFB00 erent anion sizes could form solid solutions and whether such mixing will lower the phase transition temperatures without a major loss of ionic conductivity.

We also tried to gain some insights on cation di /uniFB00 usion based on DFT calculations and MD simulations. As mentioned earlier, ionic conductivity of an SE is relevant to the concentration of charge carriers and the intrinsic jump rates of charge carriers. 47,48 Usually, the second part could be estimated using transition-state-based theories such as NEB

The phase transition temperatures were derived from previously reported experimental data. 16,17,28 (b) The cation vacancy formation energies of metal borohydrides. The red bar shows the values obtained from phase equilibria, and the blue one refers to the values from the cation extraction reaction. The detailed calculation details are shown in the Computational Method section.

The pink and white balls represent B and H atoms. The cations are omitted for clarity. (d) The mean squared displacements of cations. It is worth noting that we only show the /uniFB01 rst 10 ps of MSDs so as to maintain the consistency of the results.

calculations. However, as previously reported, since the cation hopping process is correlated with the anion rotations, it is di /uniFB03 cult to obtain the right cation hopping pathway. 101,102 Alternatively, we evaluated the cation vacancy formation energies. Cationic vacancies are bene /uniFB01 cial to the di /uniFB00 usion because they are the major charge carriers in most SEs. More cation vacancies indicate more vacant sites (or pathways) for the hopping process. Figure 7b shows the cation vacancy formation energies of Li, Na, Ca, and Mg borohydrides. On the basis of phase equilibria (as indicated by the red bars), the formation of cation vacancies in B 12H12 2 --containing phases is more di /uniFB03 cult than that in BH4 --containing phases. This is probably related to the good thermodynamic stability of the former. Also, compared with divalent metal borohydrides (Mg and Ca), monovalent metal cationic vacancies are easier to form, which is probably due to the larger electrostatic screening interaction. This indicates a lower concentration of available vacant sites and probably will lead to severe di /uniFB00 usion pathway blocking. We noticed here that the values obtained using the phase equilibria involve the reaction of anion species, which is shown in eq 2 in the Computational Method section. As mentioned earlier, such reactions may be kinetically sluggish.

Thus, we also consider the direct extraction of cations from the crystal (eq 3 in the Computational Method section is an example.) The results are consistent with those obtained from the thermodynamics. Shown as blue bars in Figure 7b, the formation energy of monovalent cationic vacancies is consistently smaller than that of divalent ones. These /uniFB01 ndings point to a low conductivity in divalent metal borohydrides. To con /uniFB01 rm this speculation, we conducted ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to study the intrinsic di /uniFB00 usion properties of Ca and Mg borohydrides. A comprehensive investigation on monovalent phases using this method can be found in a recent report by Brandon et al. 102 The nuclear densities of cations in CaB12H12 and MgB12H12 are shown in Figure 8a,b, respectively, in comparison with Na2B10H10 from our previous study (Figure 8c). 101 Despite the high simulation temperature (1000 K), Ca and Mg motions are localized, whereas Na tend to di /uniFB00 use frequently between neighboring sites. The di /uniFB00 usivity was quanti /uniFB01 ed by the mean squared displacements in Figure 8d. No obvious hopping of Ca and Mg was observed during the 10 ps time length. This implies that the di /uniFB00 usion of divalent metal cations is much slower than the monovalent ones. The van Hove correlation analysis also supports this /uniFB01 nding (see part 8, section 1 of the SI). On the basis of the concentration and the intrinsic mobility of the carriers, Ca and Mg might not be suitable as solid electrolytes. Instead, they might be used as thin coating layers to protect the electrodes due to their relatively good electrochemical stability depending on their actual ionic conductivity. We want to note here that such a coating layer does not necessarily need to be highly conductive. 103 In the simulations, due to the relatively slow cation transport, a statistically meaningful di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient cannot be computed within the current simulation time scale. Actual conductivity needs to be measured experimentally.

## 4. CONCLUSIONS

We evaluated the phase stability, electrochemical stability, and mechanical properties of metal borohydrides as SEs for SSBs based on DFT calculations. Several experimentally observed cation conductive metal borohydrides were con /uniFB01 rmed to be intrinsically stable. Under electrochemical oxidation, metal borohydrides are not thermodynamically stable and tend to be oxidized at relatively low voltages. However, the decomposition product may form a protective layer at the interface, preventing the electrolyte from further reactions and o /uniFB00 ering an improved electrochemical stability. The analysis of the mechanical properties computed using DFT indicates that metal borohydrides are ductile, suggesting that facile mechanical processing is possible. However, their relatively small shear moduli suggest that they may not be stable against Li metal dendrite growth. Implications on phase transitions and cation di /uniFB00 usion properties were obtained by relating the experimental results to the DFT calculated descriptors. The phase transition temperature was found to be positively correlated with anion rotation barriers. For divalent Mg and Ca, both vacancy formation energy calculations and MD simulations indicate low di /uniFB00 usion constants.

On the basis of this study, we believe that metal borohydrides are potentially competitive solid electrolytes for Li and Na batteries. However, before they can be used in practical devices, two issues need to be addressed. First, the room-temperature conductivity needs to be improved either by reducing the superionic phase transition temperature or by lifting the cation di /uniFB00 usivity of the low temperature phase. Second, these materials need to be characterized in real devices for a long number of cycles to rule out the e /uniFB00 ect of dendrites.
