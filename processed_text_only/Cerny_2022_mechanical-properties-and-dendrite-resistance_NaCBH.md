Matteo Brighi, Fabrizio Murgia, and Radovan Černý*

Stack pressure and mechanical robustness are two important parameters needed to tackle the interfacial instability of solid-state batteries. Here, the mechanical behavior of Na4(CB11H12)2(B12 H 12 ), as solid electrolyte at the interface with Na anode, is reported. The solid electrolyte is tested as function of stack pressure and di/uniFB00erent current densities, revealing a critical current density of 0.6 mA cm -2  at room temperature and an optimal stack pressure of 1.5 MPa. These findings are achieved, thanks to the adoption of a multilayer approach, demonstrating the powerfulness of hydroborates to compensate chemical and electrochemical instability, simply employing di/uniFB00erent complex hydride polyanions that change locally the electrochemical properties while preserving structural and chemical coherence.

## 1. Introduction

Solid-state batteries (SSBs) are leading the competition for future post-lithium  electrochemical  energy  storage  devices.  Despite this technology is theoretically very promising, allowing greater energy and larger current density, the way for application is still quite far, since all existing solid-state cells are subject to severe limitations  due  to  the  instability  of  the  solid-solid  interface between electrodes and solid electrolyte (SE). In first instance, the nature of this instability can be chemical or mechanical, [1-4] since the interface must account for deformation, ensuring no contact loss between the stacked cell components. Some approaches to mitigate these issues were proposed by means of the adoption of viscous additives (i.e., ionic liquids) at the solid-solid interface. [5]

Second, in order to realistically enhance the energy density, interfaces must be stable upon reversible electroplating on the ion source, namely Li and Na, just to mention the more likely technologies.

These arguments redefine the protagonists in the race for novel solid-state electrolytes in fulfilling requirements for a healthy evo-

lution of SSBs. Not only ion conductivity and electrochemical  stability are the essential parameters  to  consider  for  potential  prototypes, but also mechanical processing, interfacial stability during cycling, and resistance to dendrite penetration are crucial aspects.

A  widely  known  parameter  to  measure the  attitude  for  a  material  to  satisfy  these requirements is the so-called critical current density (CCD). Willing to summarize many di/uniFB00erent  CCD  definitions  in  one  sentence, the  CCD  is  the  maximum  allowed  current density above which dendrites can form. [6,7] However,  CCD  results  from  the  interplay of di/uniFB00erent parameters that a/uniFB00ect the goodness  of  the  interface  and  its  stability.  For instance,  pressure  and  temperature  can  positively  influence  the CCD,  moving  the  threshold  at  higher  values.  If  the  pressure  is su/uniFB03ciently high, the alkali metal likely falls in the plastic regime, ensuring  a  constant  deformation,  preserving  the  contact  at  the electrolyte surface and avoiding void formation. The temperature gives rise to the same e/uniFB00ect,  since  the  homologous  temperature (i.e., the ratio between room temperature and its melting temperature) is very favorable in case of sodium and lithium at ambient condition (0.80 and 0.66) and approaching the unity, ion di/uniFB00usion increases. As a consequence, the plastic regime can be achieved at lower pressure, providing the abovementioned benefits. [8]

In this work, we explored the interface stability of several hydroborates,  an  emerging  class  of  compounds  that  we  previously investigated  as  Na-based  SEs. [9] Among the  possible  choices  of room temperature (rt) ion conductors, we focused on Na 4 (CB 11 H 12 ) 2 (B12 H12) (in the following NCBB) since it represents the best option in terms of Na conductivity and electrochemical stability, as  recently  reported, [10,11] hence  being  the  most  promising  and realistic compound, among this class of materials, in a SSB.

For the present study, the pressure was considered as the only parameter a/uniFB00ecting CCD, fixing the temperature at ambient condition  (25 ° C).  The  paper  is  organized  in  the  following  way:  in the  first  part,  we  explore  the  pressure  needed  to  minimize  the interfacial resistance due to the flawed Na adhesion at the electrolyte surface. In the second part, the optimal pressure (that can provide a high current density) is investigated and, finally, at this optimum stack pressure, a CCD measurement is performed.

## 2.1. Mechanical Strength of Solid Electrolyte

At  the  laboratory  scale,  processing  of  hydroborate-based  SEs remains  challenging,  mainly  due  to  the  lack  of  knowledge  to

obtain  sintering  condition  or  surface  polishing  techniques relying in solvent-based methods, which would result in nonaggressive treatments for hydroborates.

Indeed, the majority of polar organic solvents, either protic (as  EtOH  or i -PrOH)  or  aprotic  (CH 3COCH3, THF, DME, or other  ethers),  can  dissolve  hydroborates  and  only  few  mixed anion-based  salts,  such  as  [CB 9 H10] --[CB11 H 12 ] -or  [B 10 H10] 2 --[B12 H12] 2 -,  can  recrystallize  as  conductive  compounds,  due  to the  negligible  di/uniFB00erence  in  their  respective  solubility  values. More details on this point are reported in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).

In all other mixtures, both precursors recrystallize separately as the carba-hydroborates are always more soluble compared to their hydroborate relatives. [12]

Sintering  also  must  be  rejected  because  hydroborates  and their  C-derivatives  generally  undergo  decomposition  before melting,  for  which  di/uniFB00erent  approaches,  as  pressure-induced melting, could be promising but remaining yet unexplored.

However, thanks to their softer lattices compared to oxide or halide electrolytes (for Na 2 B12 H 12, the bulk and the shear modulus amount to B = 17 .3 GPa; G = 3.3 GPa, respectively), [13] relatively low porosity (Figure S2, Supporting Information) can be achieved by cold pressing the bulky powder.

To assess this assumption, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy  (EIS)  spectra  were  collected  as  function  of  the  stack pressure. The zero pressure point consisted of a hand pressed powder,  just  to  guarantee  a  minimum  interfacial  contact.  EIS data were collected in the frequency range 1 Hz &lt; f &lt; 3 MHz and the cell resistance (electrolyte) was deduced from the frequencyindependent plateau in the Bode plot, after the linear dispersion contribution  which  comes  from  the  electrolyte/electrode  interface. This corresponds to the intercept of EIS spectra to the real axis (Nyquist plot in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

The resulting resistance was used to calculate the 'apparent' ionic  conductivity  value  at  each  pressure,  adopting  the  die's diameter  and  the  thickness  obtained  from  the  theoretical crystal  density  ( ρ = 1.1  g  cm -3 )  as  the  pellet's  dimensions. [14] This assumption is reasonable since the change in the pellet's thickness  cannot  exceed  10-15%  of  its  initial  value,  while  the variation  of  intergrain  contribution  to  the  total  resistance  can span over several orders of magnitude (see Figure 1 ).

The  aforementioned  resistance  shows  a  log-type  variation saturating to the expected value, as reported in a previous study. This value, represented in Figure 1 by the dashed line, amounts to 4 mS cm -1 , which is in agreement with the rt Na-conductivity reported by Brighi et al. where the pellet was obtained by cold pressing at 550 MPa. [14]

After that, the cell was opened and sodium disks were placed on  both  sides.  The  adhesion  of  the  soft  Na  on  the  ceramic pellet surface diminishes the interfacial resistance contribution that  quickly  decreases  by  increasing  the  stack  pressure  up  to 35 MPa (Figure S4 (Supporting Information), the area specific resistance (ASR) is plotted as red circles in Figure 1 and fitted in  the  Nyquist  plot  in  Figure  S3  in  the  Supporting  Information). Above 35 MPa, the total resulting conductivity increases linearly  (i.e.,  the  cell  resistance  decreases)  as  function  of  the applied pressure and the mechanically induced short circuit is reached at 70 MPa.

The decrease of ASR is due to the improved adhesion at the surface  when  the  sodium  is  in  the  plastic  regime,  since  both

www.advancedsciencenews.com hydrostatic  pressure  and  von  Mises  stress  strongly  intensify around  the  surface's  defects. [15] Such  condition  is  easily  satisfied  for  sodium,  due  to  its  low  yield  strain  value,  estimated 0.2-0.3 MPa. [8] Hence, as shown in Figure 1, at su/uniFB03ciently high pressure ( &gt; 35 MPa), this condition is exacerbate in correspondence of interfacial inhomogeneity and defects, allowing Na filaments to propagate through the SE eventually causing the short circuit.

Interestingly, the situation is slightly di/uniFB00erent when considering the single-anion precursors: indeed, repeating the same experiment on pure NaCB11H12 or Na2B12H12, the short circuit is  obtained already at 50 and 55 MPa, respectively. Due to the low value of ionic conductivity at rt of the single anion phases (typically  10 -6 -10 -8 S  cm -1 ), [16,17] it  was  not  possible  to  appreciate any clear contributions on the EIS spectra due to the high noise. Thus, only the short circuit was determined.

However, these values are systematically lower compared to that for NCBB showed in Figure 1.

This  discrepancy  rises  questions  concerning  the  mechanical  properties  of  the  mixed-anion  phase,  since  the  same mechanical behavior should be expected for [B12 H12] 2 -, [CB11 H 12 ] -,  or  their  mixture.  The  principal  drastic  di/uniFB00erence between them is represented by the di/uniFB00erence in ionic conductivity. In order to cross-check the dependency of the latter on the Na inclusion, NaCB11H12 and Na2B12H12 were mechanically  treated,  stabilizing  their  conductive  phases  at  rt. [18] In this  case,  the  resistance  evolution can be clearly followed as function of the stack pressure for both compounds (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Once the Na disks have been introduced, at solely 5 MPa, the conductivity approaches the value obtained at 90 MPa with blocking electrodes. Then, while the electrolyte resistance keeps constant at this value, the ASR in NaCB11H12  progressively  decreases  up  to  24.5  MPa  (red  circles  in  Figure  S5a  in  the  Supporting  Information),  where  a behavior, similar to that described above, is observed and can be read as an improved contact with the Na at the SE surface. The  short  circuit  is  obtained  at  54  MPa,  in  agreement  with the crystalline NaCB11 H 12 . Figure S5b,c (Supporting Information) shows the same measurements for Na2B12H12 with two di/uniFB00erent pellet thickness. For this sample, it was not possible to observe a clear EIS contribution coming from the interface but only the total resistance can be determined from impedance spectra. Increasing the stack pressure, the conductivity reaches the value obtained at 90 MPa faster for the thin pellet (Figure  S5c,  Supporting  Information,  thickness = 0.58  mm) and  at  solely  19.5  MPa,  the  cell  resistance  drops,  as  sign  of a  short  circuit.  This  experiment  was  designed  in  order  to understand if the pellet thickness plays a role in delaying the creep-induced propagation of Na through the SE. This seems the  case  since  only  for  thinner  Na 2 B12 H 12 ,  the  short  circuit is obtained at 19.5 MPa, while for the others, the breakdown pressure falls always in the region 50-60 MPa. The di/uniFB00erent breakdown values could be associated to a kinetic aspect due to  the  Na  di/uniFB00usion  on  two  di/uniFB00erent  length  scales.  Notwithstanding,  a  common  aspect  is  represented  by  the  onset  of what  we  called  'sodium  inclusion.'  The  pressure  range  for this  e/uniFB00ect  is  narrower,  amounting  reasonably  at  20  MPa  for Na2B12H12 and NaCB11H12, while rising to 30 MPa for NCBB. Work that is more extensive must be performed in order to

fully  characterize  the  dependence  of  mechanical  properties on  chemical  composition  of  hydroborates.  Up  to  this  pressure,  the  ASR  is  minimized,  providing  an  optimal  Na-SE contact. Beyond this critical value, mechanically induced Na propagation  is  not  hindered  and  according  to  our  findings, the  resistance  to  penetration  follows  the  trend  Na 2 B12 H 12 &lt; NaCB11H12 &lt; NCBB.

## 2.2. Na Electroplating at the Interface

If a too high pressure can mechanically induce short circuits, [19] or accelerate the dendrite propagation, on the other hand a too low stack pressure cannot hinder the formation of voids during the Na stripping process. [15]

Indeed,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  during  this  process, the Na flow at the interface must be sustained by an appropriate Na  di/uniFB00usion  toward  the  bulk  electrolyte.  This  can  be  easily obtained  when  sodium  is  in  the  plastic  regime,  namely  for pressure higher than the yield stress, which has been recently estimated to be in the range 0.2-0.3 MPa. [8,20]  When this condition is not guaranteed, once the sodium at the interface has diffused into the electrolyte, a surface void can form. Such e/uniFB00ect can  be  detrimental  for  the  cell  operation,  since  the  e/uniFB00ective area  reduces  and  the  current  density  locally  increases  where Na is still in contact with the SE. In such condition, interfacial spots easily undergo a current density above the nominal CCD. Therefore,  such  condition  can  act  as  source  of  stress,  forcing the interfacial defects to evolve in cracks and fractures of the SE body.  Such  cracks  pave  the  way  for  Na  extrusion  as  filaments and dendrites.

For  this  reason,  an  appropriate  stack  pressure  is  crucial  to assure a healthy, long-life cycling of the battery.

To explore this aspect, the methodology used by Wang et al. was  adopted  in  this  work. [21] The  voltage  profile  was  monitored  as  a  function  of  time  under  galvanostatic  condition.  To probe the e/uniFB00ect of pressure on the stripping process, the stack pressure  was  gradually  decreased,  starting  from  the  upper limit of 1.5 MPa. Such value was chosen to be consistent with Wang et al. who adopted for Li-based system an upper pressure of  3  MPa.  In  this  work,  the  values  are  halved  since  the  yield strength of sodium is, at least, 2 times lower. In order to minimize the ASR contribution, the sample was previously conditioned at higher pressure (see Figure 1 and Figure S5a in the Supporting Information).

In order to explore the limiting condition and exacerbate the interfacial stability, the current density was fixed at 1 mA cm -2 and the length of each pressure sweep amounts to 1 h. This corresponds to a total charge of 1.8 C and it is equivalent to adopt a  cathode with a specific capacity of 120 mAh g -1 and  a  mass loading of 8 mg cm -2  (3.5 C cm -2 ).

In Figure 2 ,  the  cell  polarization  matches  the  Ohmic  resistance  measured  by  impedance  spectroscopy  (38.9 Ω and  corresponding  to  an  ionic  conductivity  of  4  mS  cm -1 ).  While  the voltage  is  steady,  or  slowly  increasing,  a  significant  change  is observed when the pressure drops below 1 MPa. The interfacial stripping/plating further deteriorates when the pressure reduces at  0.3  MPa,  as  shown  by  a  voltage  profile,  which  is  typical  of inhomogeneous  stripping/plating  and  eventually  of  metallic

dendrite's evolution. In summary, a pressure higher than 1 MPa can, at this condition, likely sustain a plastic regime. However, to be more conservative, a stack pressure of 1.5 MPa was selected to  perform  the  CCD  characterization.  In  such  condition,  the exchanged charge for each cycle was fixed to be 0.5 C, equivalent to  a  cathode  with  specific  capacity  of  120  mAh  g -1 and  a  mass loading of 2.3 mg cm -2 . These values are still one order of magnitude lower with respect to the typical state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries [22]  but comparable to the current liquid and solid Na-based batteries reported in literature. [11,23-25] Surprisingly, the first result of CCD measures on NCBB was quite disappointing since the determined current limit was rather low (0.1 mA cm -2 ,  see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information) but perfectly reproducible either in pristine and recycled NCBB (see the Experimental Section).  For  instance,  Asakura  et  al.  cycled  a  4  V  Na  battery using the same solid electrolyte at even higher current density. [11] This  finding  then  raised  concerns  about  the  anodic  stability  of such  compound,  since  already  during  the  conditioning  period (consisting in ten 30-min sweeps at 10 µ A cm -2 ),  the interfacial resistance  evolved  remarkably  (Figure  S7,  Supporting  Information).  Anodic  instability  was  already  observed  for  open-cage nido -hydroborates  (namely  LiB 11 H 14 and  NaB11H14), [26,27] suggesting a tendency to react with lithium due to the accentuated H anisotropy on the boron cluster. The decomposition products could slightly widen the reductive limit, allowing slow-rate symmetrical cell, as was reported by Payandeh et al. [27]  This suggests that a similar behavior can take place in NaCB 11 H 12 -based compound,  as  interfacial  resistance  evolution  was  already  observed in the past on symmetric Na cells. [11,14]  This was not the case for Na2B12H12-based compounds, observed to be stable at low potential versus Na. [28]

Meanwhile, as mentioned above, it was shown that mechanical  treatment  on  Na 2 B12 H 12 can  stabilize  the  high  conductive polymorph  at  rt. [18] We  therefore  realized  a  multilayer  pellet in  order  to  explore  the  interfacial  stability  realizing  a  coating of  ball-milled  Na 2 B12 H 12 .  The  thickness  of  such  layer  is  about 60-70 µ m (Figure S8, Supporting Information). The resulting CCD is shown in Figure 3 a (entirely in Figure 3b). Good interfacial adhesion between layers was confirmed from EIS spectra

where no additional  contribution  can  be  detected  (Figure  3c), giving  a  total  conductivity  of  3.6  mS  cm -2 (measured  pellet thickness  0.142  cm),  perfectly  in  agreement  with  the  above reported  value  for  NCBB.  The  voltage  polarization  shows  a deviation  from  the  Ohmic  behavior  because  of  the  dendrites penetration/evolution.

Looking at Figure 3a, the cell polarization shows an Ohmic behavior  up  to  2.2C,  corresponding  to  a  current  density  of 0.6 mA cm -2 .  Further increase of the current density modifies the voltage profile in the typical feature related to dendrite evolution, as it was recently reported by Kazyak et al. [7]

Based on this model, the initial increase in cell polarization is likely linked to the decrease in the e/uniFB00ective contact area ( A e/uniFB00 ). Since ASR is directly proportional to the latter (ASR = R int∙ A e/uniFB00 ), inhomogeneity  at  the  interface  and  surface  roughness  could provoke depleted Na regions, eventually reducing A e/uniFB00 .  Further increase of the current density (0.8 mA cm -2 ) reveals a di/uniFB00erent behavior  of  dendrite  evolution,  still  observed  by  Kazyak  et  al. with  operando  optical  microscopy.  The  valley  observed  in  the voltage  profile  results  from  the  interplay  of  two  e/uniFB00ects.  The first  already  mentioned, that increases the cell polarization by formation  of  voids  and  depleted  regions  at  the  interface.  The second  is  related  to  the  dendrite  propagation  across  the  SE that  increases A e/uniFB00 and  reduces  the  distance  between  the  electrodes (i.e., the electrolyte thickness), hence decreasing the total resistance.

Figure 4. Symmetrical  Na | NCBB | Na  cell  cycled  at  1.4  mA  cm -2 (5  C) showing  three  selected  regions  of  the  voltage  cell  evolution.  The  cell showed has been cycled at a current twice as high as the previously determined CCD, resulting in noisy data. However, the experiment proves that the hydroborate solid electrolyte can support 100 cycles without shorting.

This  behavior  changes  remarkably  at  7 .2C  (corresponding to  a  current  density  of  2  mA  cm -2 )  where  the  voltage  profile strongly oscillates even below its initial Ohmic value of 78 Ω . In literature,  the  CCD  determination  is  sometimes  related  to  the unambiguous short circuit of the cell, but also to the deviation of the cell polarization from its Ohmic regime. [29-31] In this case, the  situation  is  closer  to  that  observed  by  Gupta  et  al.  for  the soft polymer electrolyte PEO-LiTFSI [32]  which, however, was not supported  by  any  stack  pressure,  thus  predominantly  a/uniFB00ected from depletion regions at the interface during Li stripping.

While no interfacial resistance was detected prior to the CCD experiment, after having performed the CCD measure (where the  final  applied  current  amounts  to  8  mA  cm -2 ),  the  impedance  spectra  reveal  a  small  interfacial  contribution,  while  the electrolyte  resistance  is  nearly  one  third  of  the  initial  value (Figure 3c).  This  confirms  both  the  hypothesis  of  void  formation  (increased  interfacial  resistance)  and  dendritic  growth across the NCBB (lower total resistance).

It has been observed that the rate of dendritic growth increases linearly with the current density. [7]  In order to confirm our findings and univocally assign the CCD value for NCBB, a symmetric galvanostatic  test  was  performed  upon  the  same  experimental condition (1.5 MPa, exchanged charge 0.5 C and 10 conditioning cycles at 10 µ A cm -2 )  on  a  freshly  prepared pellet. This sample (still  with a thin layer of ball-milled Na 2 B12 H 12 on each surface) was cycled with a nominal current density of 1.4 mA cm -2 (5C) which  approximately corresponds to an intermediate value between the two extremes discussed above.

The  initial  cycles  shown  in Figure 4 are  characterized  by  a peculiar asymmetry, which is absorbed in nearly 10 cycles. Nevertheless, already on the first cycle, we detect the feature previously observed for current higher than 0.6 mA cm -2 (1.8C) in Figure 3. Then, the voltage profile is steadily reproducible up to 100 cycles, preserving the Ohmic regime. However, slightly later (from cycle n ° 110),  the  cell  polarization becomes unstable, probably due to a nearly complete dendrite penetration, as supported by the EIS spectra of selected cycles (Figure S9, Supporting Information).

## 3. Conclusions

closo -Hydroborates approach the batteries field as rather young compounds, lacking many aspects of complete characterization as already provided for veterans, like garnet oxides, glassy halides,  and  thiophosphates.  Nonetheless,  they  represent  newer possibilities to overcome the limitations often reported for the latter,  as  wider  electrochemical  stability,  low  gravimetric  density,  and  high  ionic  conductivity.  Here,  we  tried  to  explore  for the first time the mechanical behavior and the interface robustness employing them as SE.

Being conscious that a huge space for improvement is still present,  from  processing  to  pellet  fabrication,  it  seems  that  a stack pressure higher than 30 MPa (20 MPa for single anions species)  can  extrude  Na  across  the  SE,  fracturing  the  ceramic and  causing  short  circuit.  Despite  a  pressure  of  30  MPa  is necessary to obtain a homogenous contact creating conformal interfaces between Na and SE, a much lower pressure (1.5 MPa) is  needed  to  obtain  reversible  steady  Na  plating/stripping, in  agreement  with  Doux  et  al. [19] At  such  experimental  condition, it is interesting to note that the estimated CCD amounts to  0.6  mA  cm -2 ,  very  close  to  the  value  recently  reported  for Li 7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) which is 0.7 mA cm -2  or between 0.5 and 1.0  mA  cm -2 as  NASICON  and  argyrodites. [33-36] In  that  context,  Liu  et  al.  explain  that  dendrites  in  LLZO  nucleate  from the ceramic body, at the grain boundaries where the local band structure could be di/uniFB00erent from the bulk and, therefore, prone to  Li  reduction  because  of  the  local  voltage  fluctuation  above the  CCD  condition.  At  this  stage,  we  cannot  exclude  that  the same process is active also in closo -hydroborates.

On  the  other  hand,  a  systematic  study  of closo -hydroborates  is  still  missing,  since  we  concentrated  primarily  on Na4(CB11H12)2(B12 H 12 ),  but  how  it  was  previously  reported,  a wide variety of mixed-anion hydroborates exists with di/uniFB00erent SE electrolyte properties, including higher rt ionic conductivity compared to NCBB of the current work. [9]  Tu et al. showed that a higher ionic conductivity is beneficial for a stable Li electrodeposition and therefore it can be assumed that this holds also for sodium electroplating. [15]

We are also aware that the CCD value here determined could mislead the e/uniFB00ective  SE  stability.  Indeed,  we  tested  in  a  symmetrical configuration, two process that are intrinsically asymmetric (plating and stripping). This was recently pointed out by Kazyak et al. [7] and further explored by Zhang et al., [37]  showing that  in  general  during  stripping,  the  interface  inhomogeneity has  the  tendency  to  flatten  if  an  adequate  stack  pressure  is present.  We  conclude  that  this  is  true  in  our  case  for  a  stack pressure of 1.5 MPa since, even beyond the CCD (Figure 4), the average cell potential gradually decreases, implying a favorable trend  of  the  ASR,  indicating  an  interface  evolution  toward  a more conformal scenario.

By contrast, high-rate plating preferentially  accumulates cations (i.e., Na + )  at  high  stress  contact points, nucleates preferentially  on  these  locations  the  columnar-like  plating,  widely known as dendrites. The cell shown in Figure 4 failed after 140 cycles, but instability in the voltage profile was present already at 50% of its operating time.

In conclusion, NCBB represents a valid competitor in the context of SEs for SSB. In addition to its mechanical resistance to

Na  penetration,  placed  between  20  and  30  MPa,  the  here reported  CCD  amounts  to  0.6  mA  cm -2   and  a  minimal pressure of 1.5  MPa  permits  charge/discharge  processes at  acceptable  rate  (2.2C  for  the  configuration  of  this  work). While  this  stack  pressure  is  su/uniFB03cient  for  a  steady  stripping process,  Na  plating  appears  hitherto  an  unsolved  problem for  fast  charge.  However,  we  believe  that  this  issue  is  technological  rather  than  chemophysical  limited,  thus  preferably addressed to engineer solutions. Related to this point, we also demonstrated  the  powerfulness  of  hydroborates  in  compensating  chemical  instability,  simply  by  a  multilayer  approach employing di/uniFB00erent complex hydride polyanions, that change locally the electrochemical properties, but preserving a chemical and structural coherence.

Materials : The hydroborate precursors, namely Na2B12H12 and NaCB11H12,  were  purchased  at  Katchem  and  dried  for  12  h  at  180 ° C under  dynamic  vacuum  ( p ≈ 10 -3 mbar).  Then,  the  synthesis  of  the mixed phase NaCB11H12 and Na2B12H12 in molar ratio 2:1 was conducted as  reported  in  a  previous  work. [14]   Sodium  was  purchased  at  Acros Organics  ( &gt; 99.8%)  and  calendered  into  1  mm  thick  sheet.  Disks  of 8 mm diameter were cut out and scraped to obtain polished surfaces. In order to obtain conductive Na 2 B 12H12 and NaCB11H12, the dry powder was mechanically treated for 45 min in stainless steel vial with a Spex 7000 (ball-to-mass ratio 200:1).

During the experiments, the used NCBB pellets were recycled. For this  purpose,  the  Na  disks  were  manually  detached  from  the  NCBB pellet surface, while residual Na  traces, including Na  dendrites were  removed  by  soaking  the  pellet  in i -PrOH  (Fisher  Chemical, &gt; 99.8%). While Na reacted immediately with the solvent, the dissolution  kinetics  for  NCBB  was  relatively  low,  allowing  the  two components  to  be  satisfactorily  separated.  Once  all  Na  traces  were eliminated,  the  NCBB  pellet  was  removed  and  completely  dissolved in  water.  After  a  further  drying  treatment  on  the  powder  at  180 ° C under  dynamic  vacuum,  NCBB  was  reprocessed  following  the  same procedure described in literature. [14]

Electromechanical Characterization : Both mechanical and electrochemical characterizations were conducted in ASC-T cell (Sphere Energy  SAS)  with  adjustable  pressure,  ranging  from  0  to  400  MPa, and  a  sample  holder  of  8  mm  diameter,  placed  in  an  Ar-containing glove  box  (H 2 O  and  O2 &lt; 0.1  ppm).  Impedance  spectroscopy,  CCD, and  galvanostatic  characterization  were  performed  with  a  SP-200 potentiostat  (Biologic  SA)  equipped  with  an  ultralow  current  probe. Impedance  spectroscopy  was  collected  in  a  frequency  range  100 mHz-3  MHz  with  a  10  mV  voltage  signal.  Studying  the  mechanical resistance  to  dendrite  penetration,  first  NCBB  was  consolidated  by cold  pressing  the  powder  into  a  solid  pellet.  EIS  was  continuously collected up to 100-120 MPa, where the impedance spectra saturated to  an  asymptotic  value.  Then,  8  mm  diameter  Na  disks  were  cut, scraped on both surfaces, and added on both pellet sides. EIS was, as described before, continuously recorded increasing the stack pressure until the short circuit was reached.

The  protocol  followed  to  obtain  the  CCD  profile  was  reported  in ref. [38] and consisted of 10 conditioning cycles of 1 h each, at low current density  (10 µ A  cm -2 ).  Then,  the  current  was  progressively  increased, every cycle, up to the maximum value of 8 mA cm -2 , imposing a 10 min resting time at the end of each sweep.

Structural Characterization : X-ray powder di/uniFB00raction was performed on Panalytical Empyrean, in Debye-Scherrer geometry and with a Cu K α 1,2 radiation. Samples were measured in 0.5 mm glass capillaries. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the surface morphology (Zeiss LEO-1455  VP),  equipped  with  secondary  emission  and  backscattered electron detectors.
