With the growing demand for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, Li-rich Mn-based layered oxide (LLO) cathodes with high specific capacity and low cost receive significant attention in conventional liquid lithium-ion batteries. However, LLO is rarely used in sulfide all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) because of severe interfacial side reactions with sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs), especially at a high operation voltage of 4.8 V (vs Li/Li + ). In this work, a dual-function modification strategy is proposed to enable electrochemically stable LLO in sulfide ASSLBs. The covalent Ru ─ Obond formed by Ru-doping can not only stabilize lattice oxygen, preventing further interfacial decomposition involving oxygen, but also enhance the ability of Li di/uniFB00usion in Li 2 MnO3 component, and then stimulate the activation of Li 2 MnO3 phase. Meanwhile, the surface sulfidation strategy establishes a highly stable interface, contributing to the rapid ionic transport at LLO/LPSCl interface. Results show that the modified LLO in sulfide ASSLBs delivers two times higher initial discharge capacity and an extra-long life of 2022 cycles of up to 4.2 V (vs Li-In) (with &gt; 70% capacity retention at 1 C). This research enriches the strategies for improving interfacial compatibility between LLO cathodes and sulfide SEs, thus providing new inspiration for guiding the application of LLO in sulfide ASSLBs.

## 1. Introduction

All-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) using nonflammable inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted increasing attention due to their excellent safety, wide range of operating temperatures, and the possibility of achieving high energy density. [ 1-4]

Recently, sulfide SEs have been considered one of the most promising systems for ASSLBs because of their high room-temperature ionic conductivity comparable to liquid electrolytes, and desirable ductility/elasticity. [ 5-9] At the same time, some conventional cathodes such as LiCoO2 [ 10,11] and Ni-rich oxide cathodes [12-14] have already been successfully applied in sulfide ASSLBs, but most are limited to less than 200 mAh g -1 due to the material's own capacity limitation. Di/uniFB00erent from the conventional cathode materials that only provide capacity from transition-metal (TM) ions redox, Li-rich Mn-based layered oxide (LLO) cathode materials can trigger oxygen redox activities to provide extra capacities ( &gt; 250 mAh g -1 ), breaking the capacity bottleneck originating from pure TM-centered redox activities. [ 15-17] Therefore, it is appealing to apply LLO cathode materials in ASSLBs to improve their practical energy density. Unfortunately, the investigation on LLO in sulfide ASSLBs is still missing, with the ion transport mechanism and interfacial problem untouched. Therefore, it is necessary and critical to study LLO in sulfide ASSLBs.

Several limitations and challenges impede the practical application of LLO in sulfide ASSLBs: 1)The interfacial space charge layer (SCL) due to the electrochemical potential di/uniFB00erence between LLO cathodes and sulfide SEs. 2) Inevitable deterioration

of LLO/sulfide SE interface by O-involving interfacial degradation/reaction at high voltage, since the high capacity of LLO materials originates from the lattice oxygen redox reaction of the Li 2 MnO3 phase, which is accompanied by the release of active oxygen. 3) The severely constrained activation of Li 2 MnO3 during the first charge due to poor Li-ion transport kinetics, thus hindering the specific capacities of LLO materials in ASSLBs. [ 18] It is found that the introduction of protective coatings on cathodes is one of the most e/uniFB03cient methods to solve the interfacial problem of sulfide ASSLBs. [19,20] On one hand, an electrochemically stable interfacial coating layer can serve as a bridge to mitigate lithium chemical potential di/uniFB00erences between electrolytes and cathodes to reduce the SCL e/uniFB00ect. On the other hand, artificial coating layers can prevent side reactions caused by the direct contact between cathode material and SEs, protecting SEs from further decomposition and improving interfacial stability.

Therefore, to solve the above three issues of LLO in sulfide ASSLBs, we put forward a dual-function modification strategy with bulk-phase doping and surface sulfidation, which is a very important step for the stable operation of LLO with an extremely high specific capacity in sulfide ASSLBs. As shown in Figure 1 , a trace amount of Ruthenium (Ru) was first introduced to synthesize Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co0.13 Mn0.54 Ru0.01O2 (LLO-Ru) to facilitate Li di/uniFB00usion in Li 2 MnO3 component, stimulating the limited activation of Li 2 MnO3 phase. At the same time, Ru-doping itself enhances oxygen lattice stability due to the involvement of strong covalent bonding of Ru ─ O, preventing further electrochemical oxidization of sulfide SEs to form interfacial side-reaction products. Furthermore, a time-/cost-e/uniFB00ective sulfidation strategy is exploited to obtain an ultrathin (10 nm) and uniform surface layer on the surface of LLO-Ru cathode, which can not only construct a stable interface to promote Li + transport at the LLO-Ru /sulfide SE interface but also e/uniFB00ectively alleviate the SCL e/uniFB00ect due to the low electron conductance of the interface layer. As a result, modified LLO-Ru@S exhibits superior electrochemical performance, including satisfactory rate capability (140.6 mAh g -1 at 0.5 C) and an ultra-long life of 2022 cycles with &gt; 70% capacity retention at 1 C of up to 4.2 V (vs Li ─ In) in sulfide ASSLBs. Importantly, indepth detailed analyses are performed to reveal the essential rea-

## 2. Results and Discussion

## 2.1. Structure and Morphology

The preparation processes for Li-rich layered oxide (LLO), Rudoped LLO (LLO-Ru), sulfurized LLO (LLO@S), and sulfurized LLO-Ru (LLO-Ru@S) are described in the experimental section. As shown in Figure 2 a, the scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) mapping of LLO indicated a uniform distribution of Ni, Co, and Mn in LLO particles. The EDS mapping of LLO@S (in Figure S1, Supporting Information) demonstrates that the distribution of S overlaps with the distributions of Ni, Co, and Mn elements, confirming their uniform distributions on the LLO particle surface. Figures S2 and S3 (Supporting Information) also demonstrate that trace amounts of Ru and S are uniformly distributed in the nanosized crystalline bulk area of LLO-Ru particles and LLORu@S particles, respectively. The structural characterization of all powders is shown in Figure 2b. X-ray di/uniFB00raction (XRD) results of the four samples can be indexed to an /u1D6FC -NaFeO2 hexagonaltype structure with R-̄ 3mspace group. The superlattice peak (red line) at 20-30 ° can be classified as the structure of Li 2 MnO3-like component (C2/m space groups). [21,22] All peaks can be well indexed to a two-phase composite. Moreover, no additional impurity peaks can be observed, indicating that the surface sulfurization and bulk-phase doping modification do not change the crystal structure of LLO. To deeply understand the structural and crystalline information of LLO-Ru materials, Rietveld refinement with goodness-of-fitting parameters /u1D712 2 (2.04) was performed on XRD spectra (Figure 2c). Detailed structural parameters from the refinement are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). As seen from the table, the c-lattice parameter and c/a ratio did not change much after Ru doping, [23] again indicating that Ru doping has little e/uniFB00ect on the crystal structure of LLO materials.

The e/uniFB00ects of sulfurization and doping in the surface morphology and structure of four samples are carefully probed at the atomic scale by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM). In Figure 3 a, by identifying boundaries in LLO with atomicresolution STEM imaging, the sample surface is found to contain a minor spinel-like phase and rock-salt phases ≈ 1-1.6 nm. The integrated spinel/rock salt surface structure can significantly increase the cycle stability. [ 24] TEMwas used to determine the effect of sulfurization on surface structure modification. Figure S4 (Supporting Information) shows a ≈ 10 nm thick sulfide layer on the LLO particle surface, which has an obviously di/uniFB00erent structure from the bulk crystalline region. The measured interplanar spacing of LLO@S sample is ≈ 0.49 nm, corresponding well to the (003) crystal plane of LLO. Combining these findings with XRD (Figure 2b) and TEM-EDS results (Figure S1, Supporting Information), it can be concluded that LLO with a sulfide coating

layer was successfully constructed, having no influence on the bulk structure of LLO cathode materials. The sulfide layer constructs a stable interface to prevent direct contact between electrode materials and sulfide SEs, thus suppressing interfacial side reactions. Figure 3b shows atomic images of LLO-Ru, in which the boundary between the rock-salt and layered phases ( ≈ 1 nm) has a disordered layered phase feature. This result reveals that the introduction of Ru a/uniFB00ected both phases of LLO. The atomic image of LLO-Ru@S sample is shown in Figure 3c. As a result of surface modification and bulk-doping treatment, more rocksalt phases are generated on the LLO surface with a thickness of 3 nm, which is conducive to the excitation of more activation degrees of Li 2 MnO3 phases.

## 2.2. Electrochemical Properties

The electrochemical performance of pristine LLO is evaluated in liquid-electrolyte batteries (LIBs) and sulfide ASSLBs. Figure S5 (Supporting Information) shows the electrochemical performance in LIBs at room temperature (RT). In conventional LIBs, the initial specific charge/discharge capacities of LLO reach 327.87/282.82 mAh g -1 at 0.1 C. In sharp contrast, their sulfide ASSLBs ( Figure 4 a) deliver initial charge/discharge capacities of 113.8/54.8 mAh g -1 at RT, which are far smaller than the normal level. Specifically, the charging plateau corresponding to Liion extraction from LiTMO 2 is significantly shortened, without oxygen-ion activation contribution of Li 2 MnO3 phase in sulfide ASSLBs. This indicates that Li-ion transport is seriously hindered to restrict the activation of Li2MnO3 during the first charging, which may be caused by the high impedance of LLO/LPSCl interface induced by serious side reactions. In contrast, the charging plateaus of LLO-Ru@S cathode corresponding to LiTMO 2 and Li 2 MnO3 phases are longer with a smaller overpotential than LLO, indicating e/uniFB00ectively enhanced Li ion transport kinetics due to the following reasons. On one hand, the involvement of strong covalent bonding of Ru ─ O by Ru doping enhances oxygen lattice stability of LLO [ 25,26] and inhibits the interfacial side reactions caused by oxygen release in LLO samples, constructing a stable interface for facilitated ionic migration. On the other hand, the sulfide coating layer greatly improves the interfacial compatibility between the LLO oxide cathode and sulfide SE. The higher Li + di/uniFB00usion coe/uniFB03cient of LLO-Ru@S is confirmed by CV curves at various scan rates (in Figure 6). Figure 4b compares the firstcycle CV curves of the four materials. The LLO-Ru@S sample exhibits stronger oxidation and reduction peaks, attributable to the better kinetic processes at the LLO-Ru@S/LPSCl interface. Notably, the oxidation peaks attributed to Li 2 MnO3 are significantly stronger than those of the other three materials, corroborating more activation of Li 2 MnO3. The first four-cycle CV curves of LLO-Ru@S samples in sulfide ASSLBs are shown in Figure 4c, where two major redox peaks appear in the regions of ≈ 3.4 V (vs Li ─ In) and ≈ 4.0 V (vs Li ─ In). The initial anodic peaks at ≈ 3.4 V (vs Li ─ In) should correspond to the reduction reaction

of TMs, and the ≈ 4 V (vs Li ─ In) peak can be attributed to the activation process of Li 2 MnO3. [27,28] After the first cycle, the anodic peaks at ≈ 4.0 V (vs Li ─ In) peak almost disappeared. No additional peaks for Ru redox were observed, possibly due to the trace doping amount of Ru. The cyclic performance of the four materials was further evaluated at 0.1 C at RT (Figure 4d). Compared with pure LLO materials, the initial specific discharge capacities of LLO-Ru@S sample are significantly increased. Figure 4e shows the long cyclic performance of LLO-Ru@S cathode at 0.1 C at RT. It can be seen that after 650 cycles, the capacity of LLORu@S ASSB has almost no attenuation, demonstrating excellent interfacial stability between LLO-Ru@S and LPSCl during the electrochemical processes. However, due to the limited contact between LLO and SE particles, the Li-ion transport kinetics across the cathode/SE interface are sluggish. As a result, although the capacity of LLO-Ru@S material has increased significantly, it is still below the performance level of LIBs, sacrificing the advantage of LLO's high specific capacity. Therefore, to further improve the ion-transportation dynamics of the four materials, all ASSBs were tested at 55 ° C. As shown in Figure 4f, the charge and discharge capacities of pristine LLO at 55 ° C are obviously enhanced (209.8 and 119.9 mAh g -1 , respectively). It can be seen from the charging plateau that LiTMO 2 phase is fully activated, while the activation of the Li 2 MnO3 phase is still limited, due to the poor conductivity of Li 2 MnO3 and incompatible interface structure in sulfide ASSLBs. In sharp contrast, the charging capacity of LLO-Ru@S electrode is up to 301.1 mAh g -1 .

Adv. Funct. Mater. 2024 , 34 , 2309822

The charging platform indicates that the low capacity of LLO in ASSLBs is mainly due to the limited activation of the Li2MnO3 phase. Due to the dual modification strategy of bulk Ru doping and sulfide layer, good interfacial compatibility promotes the bulk/interfacial transport of ions, such that the discharge capacity of LLO-Ru@S can reach 204 mAh g -1 . The dQ/dV (di/uniFB00erential capacity over voltage) curve in Figure 4g corresponds well with the initial discharge performance in Figure 4f, again demonstrating that more Li 2 MnO3 phase in LLO-Ru@S sample is activated. Figure 4h shows the cycling performance of the four materials at 0.5 C. The initial specific discharge capacities of LLO, LLO-Ru, LLO@S, and LLO-Ru@S in sulfide ASSLIB, are 45, 76.7, 94.1, and 140.6 mAh g -1 , respectively. This corroborates again that Ru-doping and sulfidation strategies can e/uniFB00ectively improve the electrochemical performance of LLO in sulfide ASSLBs. Figure 4i shows the rate performances of four samples at various current densities. Results show that the trend of LLO-Ru@S &gt; LLO@S &gt; LLO-Ru &gt; LLO has been realized at various current densities from 0.1 to 10 C. This is because the sulfidation strategy can build a stable interface layer, reduce the SCL, e/uniFB00ectively inhibit interface side reactions, and facilitate ion transmission at the LLO/LPSCl interface. However, sulfidation alone cannot inhibit the oxygen release of LLO materials upon cycling, and the covalent Ru ─ O bond formed by Ru-substitution can stabilize lattice oxygen, fundamentally preventing further interfacial decomposition involving oxygen. Therefore, under the dual modification of bulk and surface, a good ion transfer channel is constructed,

which can accelerate the di/uniFB00usion of lithium ions and facilitate the reaction kinetics, thus contributing to enhanced rate capability. The detailed mechanism of this positive e/uniFB00ect will be discussed further in the following sections. Moreover, ASSLB with LLO-Ru@S (Figure 4j) delivers an ultra-long life of 2022 cycles with &gt; 70% capacity retention at 1 C, which further demonstrates the superiority of the combination of LLO-Ru@S and sulfide SEs. Here, capacity retention refers to the percentage of capacity maintained after the 2022 cycle relative to that after the third cycle.

Evaluating the interfacial stability and Li-ion transport dynamics is important to explain the changes in electrochemical behavior in ASSLBs, which can be uncovered by using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in combination with distribution of relaxation time (DRT) analysis. [ 29,30] Figure 5 shows the impedance spectra variation of ASSLBs using four cathodes at 55 ° C. EIS analysis was carried out in the frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 8 MHz with an amplitude of 5 mV using a Zennium Pro electrochemical workstation. The semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance (R ct ), which mainly originates from the interfacial resistance between active material and SEs. Before testing, the ASSLBs were charged to 4.2 V (vs Li ─ In) after various cycles. Figure 5a-d shows the Nyquist plots of ASSLBs using four cathodes after 1, 5, 10, and 30 cycles. Figure 5a indicates that R ct of LLO ASSLB increases sharply from the 1st to the 30th cycle (from 1600 to 3400 ohms), attributable to severe interfacial chemical/electrochemical side reactions between the LLO cathode and LPSCl electrolyte during cycling. In sharp contrast, the LLO-Ru@S ASSLB exhibits a smaller change of R ct (Figure 5d). Notably, R ct of LLO-Ru@S after 30 cycles is still smaller than the initial R ct of LLO. This shows that LLO-Ru@S cathode composites have stable and fast interfacial

di/uniFB00usion kinetics during the electrochemical process. To accurately distinguish the evolution of R ct , DRT technology is used to decouple the resistance evolution in cathode composites during the Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation process. DRT fitting results are shown in Figure 5e-h, in which three main regions can be divided during the cycling process (labeled as R 1 , R2, and R3 ). The R 1 and R 2 peaks represent the charge transfer resistance at the cathode/LPSCl interface. [ 31,32] Since LLO consists of two phases, it is reasonable that the two peaks observed in DRT analysis correspond to R 1 and R 2 . [ 33] The R 3 peak is attributed to the solid-phase di/uniFB00usion of cathodes. [ 31,33] As shown in Figure 5e, charge transfer resistance at the interface (R 1 and R 2 ) dominates in the first cycle, while the value of R 3 increases sharply after 30 cycles. This indicates high interfacial resistance between LLO and SE, severely hindering the solid di/uniFB00usion of ions in LLO materials. Figure 5f shows that the values of R 1 , R2, and R3 after bulk Ru doping are basically equal, corroborating that Ru doping can not only improve the Li di/uniFB00usion ability in Li2MnO3 components but also inhibits the decomposition of sulfide SEs re-

lated to oxygen release due to strong covalent bonding of Ru ─ O, which is beneficial to the interfacial stability. Figure 5g shows that R 1 and R2 values of LLO@S are smaller than those of R 3 . It can be seen that the sulfurization strategy can construct a stable interface between LLO and LPSCl, e/uniFB00ectively suppressing the large interfacial resistance. It is worth noting that LLO-Ru @S sample has more Li 2 MnO3 phase, and Li 2 MnO3 phase of LLO in ASSLBs has poor Li-ion transport kinetics. [ 18] This explains that the R 1 , R2 values of LLO-Ru@S (Figure 5h) are lower than the R1 , R 2 values of LLO-@S (Figure 5g) after 30 cycles. To more intuitively understand the e/uniFB00ect of bulk and surface modification on reducing interfacial impedance, Nyquist curves of four materials after di/uniFB00erent numbers of cycles are compared, as shown in Figure 5i-l. The corresponding DRT fitting curve is shown in Figure 5m,n. Taking Figure 5m as an example, it is clear that LLORu@S has the smallest R 1 , R2, and R 3 values. It is worth noting that R 1 , R2, and R 3 of LLO-Ru are all smaller than that of LLO, which again confirms that Ru doping can stabilize lattice oxygen and thus eliminate O-involving interface degradation. In addi-

tion, LLO@S, compared with LLO and LLo-Ru, R 1 and R 2 values have been greatly decreased. This is due to the fact that the sulfide surface layer with low electron conductance inhibits the SCL. At the same time, the passivation layer can also reduce the interfacial side reactions caused by direct contact between LLO and LPSCl. Therefore the interfacial Li + transport within ASSLBs has been greatly improved. In summary, Figure 5 shows that LLO exhibits tremendous internal resistance upon cycling. However, doping and sulfurization strategies can inhibit the interfacial side reactions and thus contribute to reduced impedance. These data corroborate the benefit of interfacial stability in suppressing interfacial resistance.

Figure 6 a-d illustrates the CV curves at various scan rates, and the relationship between the peak current ( i p ) and the square root of the scan rate ( v 1/2 ) is depicted in Figure 6e. The lithiumion di/uniFB00usion rate ( D Li + ) is obtained using the Randles-Sevcik equation: [34,35]

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where n is the number of electrons in the redox reaction; A is the geometric area of the electrode (cm 2 ); C0 is the molarity of lithium ions (mol cm -3 ); and v is the potential scan rate (V s -1 ). n, A, and C 0 can be considered equal for the two samples in this paper. D Li + represents the di/uniFB00usion coe/uniFB03cient of lithium ions in a layered structure, which is related to the scan rate v and i p . Figure 6e shows the linear fitting result of i p on v 1/2 . Obviously, the di/uniFB00usion rate of LLO-Ru@S is significantly higher than that of LLO. The low di/uniFB00usion coe/uniFB03cient of LLO is associated with oxygen release and interfacial degradation at high voltages while doping vulcanization creates a stable interfacial and improves the mobility of Li di/uniFB00usion. It is widely recognized that the high interface resistance between the oxide cathode and sulfide electrolyte originates from an SCL formed at the interface. The attraction of the oxide cathode to Li + is stronger than that of the sulfide electrolyte due to the chemical voltage di/uniFB00erence, leading to a small amount of Li + migrating from the electrolyte surface to the oxide cathode side and forming a lithiumdeficient SCL. As shown in Figure 6f, LLO@S cathode exhibits the smallest electronic conductivity, indicating that the sulfide layer can significantly suppress the SCL in ASSLBs to some extent, and the electrochemical performances can be greatly improved. This is also demonstrated by the extremely low interfacial resistance described above (in Figure 5i). The di/uniFB00erence is that the electron conductance of the LLO-Ru@S electrode is slightly higher than that of the LLO@S cathode, leading to a suppressed e/uniFB00ect on relieving the spatial interface layer than that of the pure sulfide cathode. This also explains why its interfacial resistance is slightly higher than that of the LLO@S cathode.

By surface-sensitive XPS measurements, detailed chemical insights into the side reactions at LLO/LPSCl interfaces and different states are obtained. It should be noted that to maintain the same test conditions, the cathode material, and LPSCl SE were assembled into a full battery, followed by electrode disassembling for the XPS test. Figure 7 a shows the S 2p XPS spectra of LLO/LPSCl composite electrodes before cycling and after 70 cycles, and LLO-Ru@S/LPSCl composite electrodes after 70 cycles. S 2p signals split into two components because of

spin -orbit coupling, with an area ratio of ≈ 2/1. Each chemical environment of S corresponds to one 2p3/2-2p1/2 doublet. In Figure 7a, the S 2p spectrum of the pristine LLO electrode shows a main doublet with S 2p3/2 component at a binding energy (BE) of 161.7 eV (blue component), attributable to sulfur atoms of argyrodite. An extra week doublet at 160 eV can be attributed to Li 2 S, which comes from the residual reactants during the synthesis of LPSCl. [36,37] This means that the LLO cathode and the LPSCl electrolyte are chemically stable before the beginning of the electrochemical charge or discharge. This phenomenon can also be confirmed by XRD analysis of LLO/LPSCl cathode interface in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). After the 70th cycle, the intensity of the two main peaks of argyrodite LPSCl (blue component) is weaker. Meanwhile, additional components can be observed for LLO/LPSCl system. The BE of 162.1 eV (green component) in the S 2p spectra can be assigned to lithium polysulfides (Li 2 Sn ), and a large amount of the component at 164 eV (pink component) can be ascribed to polysulfide (P 2 Sx ). [ 38-40] The Li 2 Sn and P 2 Sx species originate from the side-reaction products of sulfide SE, confirming an unstable interface between the LLO cathode and sulfide SE. The side-reaction products will block ion transport and increase the interfacial resistance, eventually inducing capacity fading. In sharp contrast, the intensity of the main peaks of argyrodite LPSCl is stronger, and the intensity of signals of degradation products ( ≈ 162.1 and ≈ 164 eV) are weaker at the LLO-Ru@S/LPSCl cathode interface, accompanied by a decreased relative contents of side-reaction products. This indicates that the sulfidation strategy is beneficial for LPSCl to maintain reversible redox processes, and e/uniFB00ectively inhibit the interfacial reaction with oxide cathode during cycling. The O 1s spectra of two cathodes in XPS results are analyzed in Figure 7b. It should be noted that the experimental process is carried out in a vacuum environment, and the solid electrolyte does not contain O element. For pristine LLO, the O 1s XPS peak corresponding to lattice oxygen (O 2 -) is located at 529.3 eV. [ 41] Moreover, peaks at higher binding energy are assigned to oxidized species deposited on the surface. After 70 cycles, the lattice oxygen O 2 -with the characteristic peaks at 529.3 eV gradually weakens, with a new shoulder peak showing up at ≈ 530.8 eV, which can be ascribed to the formation of oxidized lattice oxygen (O n -). [ 42] This O 2 2 -lattice oxygen is extremely unstable and easy to react with LPSCl electrolytes, which explains well the formation mechanism of interfacial side-reaction products in the S 2p spectra. However, higher covalency of the TM ─ Obond could be beneficial for stabilizing O 2 n -. [ 43] This explains that at LLO-Ru@S/LPSCl cathode interface after 70 cycles, the intensity of the peaks at LLORu@S/LPSCl cathode interface at 530.8 eV is weaker than that at the LLO/LPSCl interface after 70 cycles, accompanied by reduced relative content of O 2 n -. The oxygen stability of LLO affects the oxygen release behavior, and the interfacial decomposition is directly related to the interfacial oxygen loss. During cycling, the lattice oxygen O 2 2 -with high reactivity violently reacted with the LPSCl electrolyte, leading to its oxidation. However, the high-stability Ru ─ O bond derived from bulk Ru doping fundamentally prevents further decomposition of LPSCl electrolytes. Therefore, the highly stable interface of LLO-Ru@S is derived from the co-modification of the sulfide layer and bulk Tu doping, which realizes enhanced long-cycle stability at high voltage.

## 3. Conclusion and Perspective

In sum, to satisfy the ever-increasing demand for high energy density and high safety, Li-rich cathode materials and Li 6 PS5 Cl sulfide SE are exploited to construct ASSLBs. LLO-Ru@S cathode was obtained by dual modification of both bulk and surface. Detailed EIS with DRT and XPS analyses unravel the underlying mechanisms of interfacial deterioration. A chemical/electrochemical compatible and stable interface was con- structed by the targeted improvement, originating from the bulkphase-stabilized lattice oxygen and the sulfidation process to suppress interfacial failure. For LLO-Ru@S cathodes, Ru doping inhibits interfacial degradation caused by oxygen release and improves the capability of Li di/uniFB00usion. The sulfide surface layer not only inhibits side reactions between sulfide SEs and cathode at high voltage but also e/uniFB00ectively alleviates the SCL e/uniFB00ect, which constructs an interface charge transfer channel to greatly improve the initial activation of Li2MnO3 phase. The strategy

adopted in this work opens up a new avenue to combine the advantages of both sulfide SE and Li-rich cathode, making it possible to develop practically applicable high-energy-density sulfide all-solid batteries.

## 4. Experimental Section

Cathode Materials Preparation : Fabrication of Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn0.54 O 2 (LLO) and Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn0.54 Ru 0.01 O2 (LLO-Ru): Pristine Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn0.54 O 2 and Ru-doped Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn0.54 Ru 0.01 O2 cathodes were synthesized by a facile solid-state method using Li 2 CO3 , Ni 0.16 Co 0.16 Mn0.68 CO 3 as raw materials and Ru 2 O as Ru source. The specific synthesis process was as follows. Mixing stoichiometric amounts of Ni 0.16 Co 0.16 Mn0.68 CO 3 , Li 2 CO3 (5% excess), and Ru 2 O by using an agate mortar or ball-milling mixed raw materials for 1 h, followed by calcination at 350 ° C for 5 h, 700 ° C for 15 h, and 860 ° C for 5 h in air atmosphere (heating rate = 3 ° C min -1 ). After naturally cooling to room temperature, LLO and LLO-Ru materials were obtained, respectively.

Synthesis of Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn0.54 O 2@S (LLO@S) and Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn0.54 Ru 0.01 O2 @S (LLO-Ru@S): The LLO and LLORu obtained above were processed by hand-grinding with a mortar and pestle for 30 min. Then, LLO and LLO-Ru were placed in an alumina crucible and transferred to a tube furnace. Next, 80 mL of liquid CS 2 (99.9%, Aladdin) was placed in a bottle. Due to the low boiling point of CS 2 , it was easily transformed from liquid to gas phase and blown into the tube furnace by a stream of N 2 gas. LLO@S and LLO-Ru@S powders were synthesized by heating LLO and LLO-Ru for 1 h in an atmosphere of mixed N 2 and CS 2 gases at 200 ° C, respectively. After naturally cooling to room temperature, LLO@S and LLO-Ru@S materials were obtained. Sulfide Solid Electrolyte Synthesis : Argyrodite Li 6 PS 5 Cl was prepared as follows: a stoichiometric mixture of LiCl (Sigma Aldrich; &gt; 99%), P 2 S 5 (MACKLIN; 99%) and Li 2 S (Sigma Aldrich; &gt; 99%) was ball milled in a

250 mL zirconia jar for 48 h at 300 rpm using a mixture of 10, 8, and 5 mmdiameter zirconia balls, with a ball to powder ratio of 40:1. The obtained powder was ground using a mortar and pestle and pressed into pellets. The pellets were sealed in a glass tube and annealed at 550 ° C for 10 h. The as-synthesized solid electrolyte has a room-temperature ionic conductivity of ≈ 3.5 mS cm -1 .

Materials Characterization : X-ray di/uniFB00raction (XRD) patterns were carried out on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance with a Cu K /u1D6FC radiation of /u1D706 = 1.54178 Å over the range of 10 ° ≤ 2 /u1D703 ≤ 80 ° .

The atomic structure was characterized by TEM (JEOL, JEM-F200) operated at 200 kV, and HADDF- STEM was conducted using a Cs- corrected STEM (FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300) operated at 300 kV.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 system with a monochromatic AlK /u1D6FC (1486.6 eV) X-ray source to investigate the relative content and the chemical state of elements. The XPS data were fitted with the asymmetric Gaussian-Lorentzian sum function in XPSPEAK software and atomic relative content calculation in Multipak software.

Cell Assembly and Electrochemical Testing : LLO(S)/LPSCl/Li ─ In allsolid-state cell: A laboratory-scale all-solid-state battery with a 10 mm diameter was assembled by exploiting cathode materials combined with Li 6 PS 5 Cl (LPSCl) sulfide solid electrolyte as the cathode layer, together with the Li 6 PS 5 Cl SE layer and Li ─ In as anode. All assembling processes were conducted in a dry argon-filled glove box. For a composite cathode, the LPSCl SE was selected to blend with cathode active materials in a weight ratio of 50:45:5 (LLO:LPSCl:VGCF) by using an agate mortar for 1 h. A mass of 80 mg sulfide SE served as the separator layer.

First, a dense SE layer was successively prepared by pressing 80 mg of SE under 240 MPa. Subsequently, 5 mg of cathode composite powder was evenly spread on one side of the SE layer, followed by applying 360 MPa pressure. Then, an indium foil (with a diameter of 10 mm diameter and a thickness of 50 µ m) was pressed on the other side, and a thin Li foil (with a diameter of 8 mm and a thickness of 30 µ m) was attached to the indium foil. Finally, this cell was fixed into a stainless steel plate case with an applied pressure of ≈ 20 MPa.

LLO/Li liquid-half cell : The Li 1.2 Ni 0.13 Co 0.13 Mn0.54 O 2 working electrodes for the liquid-half cell were prepared by spreading the slurry of active materials (90 wt.%), carbon black (5 wt.%) and PVDF binder (5 wt.%) on Al foil. After complete stirring, the steady slurry was coated onto conductive Al foil and dried at 120 ° C for 8 h. The dried electrodes were cut into a 12 mm-diameter disk as working electrodes. The Swagelok-type half-cell was assembled in an argon-filled glove box with a lithium metal disk as the counter electrode and a glass microfibre filter with a liquid electrolyte as the separator.

Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests and cycling performance of assembled all-solid-state LIBs were evaluated at RT and 55 ° C by a standard battery testing instrument (LAND CT-2001A, Wuhan Rambo Testing Equipment Co., Ltd.). All tests were performed between 1.4 and 4.2 V (vs Li ─ In) with a current rate of 0.1 C (1 C = 200 mA h). The selected test procedure includes a staircase increase of C-rate for five cycles each.

The discharge/charge tests of liquid-half cells were carried out on a Land BT2000 battery test system (Wuhan, China) at a current rate of 0.1C, in the voltage window from 2.0 to 4.8 V (vs Li/Li + ) at RT. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was carried on the electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, Shanghai, China) with a sweeping rate of 0.1 mV s -1 .
