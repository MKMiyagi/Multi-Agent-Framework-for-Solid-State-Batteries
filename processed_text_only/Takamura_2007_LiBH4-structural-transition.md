The electrical conductivity of lithium borohydride ( LiBH4 ) measured by the ac complex impedance method jumped by three orders of magnitude due to structural transition from orthorhombic to hexagonal at approximately 390 K. The hexagonal phase exhibited a high electrical conductivity of the order of 10 -3 S cm -1 . Furthermore, the conductivity calculated from the Nernst-Einstein equation using the correlation time obtained from 7 Li nuclear magnetic resonance was in good agreement with the measured electrical conductivity. It was concluded that the electrical conductivity in the hexagonal phase is due to the Li superionic conduction. ' 2007 American Institute of Physics . [ DOI: 10.1063/1.2817934 ]

Recently, we have reported that the microwave irradiation process can be applied to the dehydriding reaction of LiBH4. 1,2 The rate of the temperature increase in LiBH 4 by the microwave irradiation was drastically enhanced above 380 K, which resulted in a fast dehydriding reaction of LiBH4. At this temperature, LiBH4 undergoes a structural transition from orthorhombic [ low temperature ( LT ) phase ] to hexagonal [ high temperature ( HT ) phase ] . From the result of the permittivity measurements, it was suggested that LiBH4 is an insulator in the LT phase, while it might be conductive in the HT phase. 1 Therefore, probably due to the conductive loss, the HT phase was rapidly heated. Since hydrogen is covalently stabilized as [ BH4 ] -, which is then ionically combined with Li + , 3 it was predicted that the charge carrier is Li + and not H + .

Many investigations have been performed on LiBH 4 including those on the internal reorientation of [ BH4 ] -, 4,5 crystal structure, 6 high-pressure study, 7 and hydrogen storage properties. 8 However, there is no literature regarding studies on the motion of Li + in solid state LiBH4 ( typically below 550 K ) lytes in high-energy solid-state batteries, 9-20 it is fundamentally, and practically as well, significant to investigate the Li ionic conductivity of LiBH 4 .

Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to experimentally investigate both electrical conductivity and Li ionic motion in LiBH4. These were measured by the ac complex impedance method and 7 Li nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) , respectively. The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time T 1 was investigated by 7 Li NMR, which was compared with the electrical conductivities obtained from the ac complex impedance method in order to confirm whether the conduction carrier is Li + or not.

LiBH4 was purchased from Aldrich Co. Ltd. The electrical conductivity of LiBH4 was measured as follows. The sample was prepared by pressing into a pellet ( 10 mm in diameter and ∼ 2 mm in thickness ) without sintering. Li foils as electrodes were mechanically fixed on both faces of the

pelletized sample. The complex impedances of the sample were measured between 333 and 433 K during heating and cooling runs by a Solartron SI-1260 impedance analyzer in a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 10 MHz. The resistances of the sample were obtained from the diameter of a single arc and the intercept on the Z ′ axis in the complex impedance plots for the LT and HT phases, respectively. The 7 Li NMR measurements were performed by a Chemagnetics CMX Infinity 300 at the Li resonance frequency of 116 MHz between 323 and 533 K. The T 1 values were obtained by the inversion recovery pulse sequence. Aqueous LiCl ( 1 M ) was used as the 7 Li reference. Both the impedance and 7 Li NMR measurements were carried out under Ar atmosphere.

Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity and the complex impedance plots of LiBH4. As shown in the insets, only single arcs were observed in the complex impedance plots for both LT and HT phases, indicating that neither the response arising from the

electrode interface nor the grain boundary was observed. 21 In the heating process, the electrical conductivity increased with increasing temperature. A discontinuous jump was observed at around 390 K, which corresponds to the structural transition temperature. The electrical conductivity in the HT phase was as high as 10 -3 S cm -1 , which is comparable to those of high Li ionic conductors at room temperature. 9-15,18 Below and above 390 K, the temperature dependences of the electrical conductivity showed Arrhenius behaviors. The activation energies E a 𝛔 for the conduction were evaluated using the equation 22

where 𝛔 is the electrical conductivity, 𝛔 0 is the preexponential parameter, and k B is the Boltzmann constant. We obtained E a 𝛔 of 0.69 and 0.53 eV for the LT and HT phases, respectively. In the cooling process, the discontinuous jump of the electrical conductivity was observed at a lower temperature. The hysteresis of about 10 K was in accordance with that observed by the differential scanning calorimeter detecting the structural transition ( not shown ) .

In order to confirm whether the high electrical conductivity of LiBH4 in the HT phase is due to the fast Li ionic motion, 7 Li NMR was measured. Figure 2 shows the 7 Li ( I = 3 2 ) NMR spectra of LiBH4 at some selected temperatures. The shapes of the spectra drastically changed at the structural transition temperature. In the LT phase ( below 385 K ) , only broad and small peaks were observed. On the contrary, in the HT phase ( above 388 K ) , each spectrum showed a central sharp line ( - 1 2 ↔ 1 2 transition ) and two satellite lines 23 ( - 1 2 ↔ - 3 2 transitions ) . The decrease in the linewidth of the central line indicates the motional narrowing caused by the fast Li ionic motion in the HT phase.

The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time T 1 is shown in Fig. 3. T 1 increased with temperature and a steep decrease was observed at approximately 390 K. Above 390 K, the T 1 curve had a minimum at around 493 K, and it can be fitted by the following BloembergenPurcell-Point ( BPP ) formula: 24

where C is a constant, 𝛚 is the Larmor frequency, and 𝛕 is the correlation time of the Li ionic motion. The Arrhenius temperature dependence of 𝛕 was assumed to be 𝛕 = 𝛕 0 exp ( E a NMR / k BT ) , where E a NMR is the activation energy for the Li ionic motion and 𝛕 0 is a preexponential factor. The

parameters corresponding to the best fit with Eq. ( 2 ) were C =4.22 × 10 8 s -2 , 𝛕 0 =1.06 × 10 -15 s, and E a NMR =0.56 eV. The activation energy obtained by 7 Li NMR was almost the same as that deduced from the measured electrical conductivity in the HT phase.

According to the simple hopping model without considering a correlation effect, the electrical conductivity can be estimated by the following Nernst-Einstein equation:

where N is the number of the charge carriers per volume, D is the diffusion coefficient, and Ze is the electrical charge of the carrier. The diffusion coefficient D is expressed as D = l 2 / n 𝛕 , where l is the hopping distance and n is a dimensional factor ( n =2, 4, and 6: one-, two-, and threedimensional diffusions, respectively ) . Here, l was assumed to be the nearest Li-Li distance of 4.27 ¯ in the HT phase, 6 and N was deduced to be 1.62 × 10 22 cm -3 from the apparent density of the pelletized sample used for the complex impedance measurement. In Fig. 4, the NMR derived conductivity using the parameters described above is shown along with the electrical conductivity measured by the complex impedance method. Clearly, the NMR data showed a fairly good agreement with the measured electrical conductivity. Thus, it can be concluded that the high electrical conductivity of the

order of 10 -3 S cm -1 in the HT phase originated from the fast Li ionic motion; LiBH 4 is one of the Li superionic conductors. Moreover, the calculated electrical conductivity for n =4 showed better agreement with the measured electrical conductivity than that for n =6. As shown in Fig. 5, the nearest neighbor of Li arranges along the a and b axes without hindrance in the HT phase. 6 The rearrangement might enable the Li + to migrate along each axis. The detailed mechanism should be clarified by investigating the ionic motion in the single crystal.

In summary, both the electrical conductivity and Li ionic motion in LiBH4 were experimentally investigated. The electrical conductivity measured by the ac complex impedance method jumped by three orders of magnitude due to structural transition at approximately 390 K. The HT phase exhibited a high electrical conductivity of the order of 10 -3 S cm -1 . The temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation time T 1 showed a minimum at around 493 K, and it could be fitted by the BPP formula. The electrical conductivity calculated from the Nernst-Einstein equation using 7 Li NMR correlation times was in good agreement with that measured by the ac impedance method. From these results, it was concluded that the high electrical conductivity in the HT phase is a result of the Li superionic conduction.

- 21 The distorted arc for the HT phase was due to the inductance component of coaxial cables. By fitting ( roughly for the HT phase ) the impedance data to the equivalent circuit consisting of a parallel connection of a capacitance and a resistance, we obtained capacitances of the order of 1-100 pF.
