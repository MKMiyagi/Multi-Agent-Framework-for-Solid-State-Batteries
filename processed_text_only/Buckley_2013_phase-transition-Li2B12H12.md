The thermal decomposition of anhydrous Pa % 3 Li2B12H12 was studied in situ by high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. A first-order phase transition can be observed at 355 8 C where the unit cell volume expands by ca. 8.7%. The expanded b -Li2B12H12 polymorph simultaneously decomposes to a hydrogen poor c -Li2B12H12 /C0 x phase. Expansion of the unit cell across the discontinuity is consistent with reorientational motion of B12H12 2 /C0 anions, and the presence of a frustrated Li + lattice indicating Li ion conduction.

With intrinsically high gravimetric and volumetric density, metalhydrogen phases containing boron are appealing as potential hydrogen (H) stores for off-grid and vehicular applications, and are able to compete with Li batteries and diesel fuels on a cost and energy density basis. 1,2 In particular, the group I and II metalborohydrides such as LiBH4 and Mg(BH4)2 are of great interest, containing 18.5 and 14.9 wt% H respectively. Due to the current inability to find a temperature lowering catalytic additive, such phases must operate at temperatures higher than their melting points ( T m). For LiBH4, this results in the generation of the dodecahydrocloso -dodecaborate Li2B12H12. 3-5 The Li2B12H12 phase was found to decompose to a nanoscopic hydrogen-poor polymorph g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x . A new b -Li2B12H12 polymorph was also discovered by ageing a -Li2B12H12 ( Pa % 3 structure type 4 ) at 450 1 C and 125 bar H2 pressure. 3 The symmetry of this new polymorph could not be identified due to a low yield and insufficient reflections for unit cell indexing. Attempts to quench high yields of the b -Li2B12H12 polymorph to room temperature were unsuccessful. 3

## First-order phase transition in the Li2B12H12 system †

Polymorphism in metal-borohydrides is abundant, for example; LiBH4 displays a first-order transition from an orthorhombic to a hexagonal structure at 108 1 C with an associated order-disorder transition of the BH4 /C0 units; 6,7 Mg(BH4)2 also displays an a / b transition at 180 1 C, 8 and a g / e transition at 150 1 C. 9 Polymorphism has also been observed in the group I dodecahydrocloso -dodecaborates M2B12H12 (M = K, Rb, Cs), with a second-order transition evident at 538 1 C, 469 1 C and 236 1 Crespectively. 10 The entropic component of these second order transitions is characterised by rapid reorientational disordering of the icosahedral B12H12 2 /C0 anion. 10 Although the crystallographic coordination is preserved during these second-order transitions ( e.g. the cations and B12H12 2 /C0 icosahedral centres do not move from their original Wykoff positions), a second B12H12 2 /C0 motif is introduced into the structural model to describe the average reorientational disordered structure of the B12H12 2 /C0 anion. 10 This produces two anion positions with 50% occupancy to completely describe the crystal structure, indicating localised hopping/exchange of B and H atoms in the icosahedral B12H12 unit.

The synthesis of anhydrous Li2B12H12 from the hydrated form, Li2B12H12 /C1 x H2O, has been described in detail in a previous study. 3 In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) data on the thermal decomposition of Li2B12H12 was collected on the Powder Diffraction Beamline at the Australian Synchrotron. Details regarding the diffractometer setup and intrinsic resolution have been reported in previous work. 11 This study utilises a wavelength of l = 1.000026 Å, with complete diffraction patterns collected every 1 minute, during temperature ramping of 5 1 C per minute under dynamic vacuum. The sample was sealed within a sapphire capillary (1 mm diameter, Crytur) to enable the high temperature in situ diffraction study. Temperature programmed desorptionmass spectroscopy (TPD-MS) of Li2B12H12 was conducted at 2 1 C per minute under dynamic vacuum up to 630 1 C.

Fig. 1a shows the temperature dependent diffraction data from Li2B12H12 up to 630 1 C. There is a clear shift in the reflections (111) and (200) at ca. 355 1 C. By ca. 550 1 C, no sharp crystalline reflections are evident, and only a broad halo remains (Fig. S1, ESI†), consistent with the release of H according to the

TPD-MS in Fig. 1b. This broad halo is consistent with the H-poor g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x observed in our previous study. 3 The H-poor g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x phase is stable until ca. 650 1 C, when amorphous B can be observed to form. 3 Initial indexing of the post-step diffraction pattern revealed that the main (111) and (200) intensities were preserved with cubic unit cell symmetry. However, some higher angle reflections were quenched, becoming unobservable compared to their moderate intensities in the pre-step Pa % 3 structure. This suggests that B and H atoms have moved off their static positions, consistent with reorientational disorder.

Fig. 2a shows the temperature dependent variation of the Li2B12H12 lattice parameter, while Fig. 2b compares the diffraction patterns pre and post step. The unit cell volume is expanded by ca. 8.7% across the step. The discontinuous behaviour of the unit cell strongly indicates that a first-order phase transition has occurred. The fact that (111) and (200) remain in the post step b -Li2B12H12 diffraction data indicates that the B12H12 2 /C0 icosahedra retain a similar coordination to the pre-step Pa % 3 environment, as the (111) planar spacing is indicative of the lateral spacing of B12H12 2 /C0 icosahedral centres. Reflections such as (502) that are generated from B atoms within a B12H12 2 /C0 icosahedral unit are strongly quenched post step. This quenching is consistent with the reorientational disordering of B and H positions that has been observed in second-order phase transitions in Cs2B12H12. 10 Reflections such as (021) and (211) whose intensity is &gt;90% generated from Li + cations are also similarly quenched, suggesting that Li + cations are also undergoing a form of disordered motion. In this respect, the first-order polymorphic transition of Li2B12H12 at ca. 355 1 C retains the same basic symmetry as the pre step Pa % 3 structure, but with thermally induced disorder of the B, H and Li positions (hopping/exchange). Such a transformation is symmetry

preserving, and may be regarded as a zero-order isosymmetric phase transition. It is notable that temperature induced zero-order isosymmetric phase transitions are extremely rare, and less than 10 phases are known to exhibit these properties. 12 Zero-order isosymmetric reactions are known to occur in framework structures with large coordination environments around cations. 12

Utilising an averaged multiple icosahedra model, 10 we have included a second B12H12 2 /C0 motif in the post step Pa % 3 structure, with 50% occupancy of each B and H position. Further analysis of the Li + cation framework indicated that the Li partially migrated to a 24-fold ( x , x , 1 /C0 x ) Wykoff position (therefore quenching (021) and (211)), yielding a more symmetric distribution of Li, with an average 25% occupancy on each of the 8c and 24d positions. The multiple icosahedra/Li model reduces w 2 from 1.677 to 1.592 and noticeably improves the fit to minor peaks. This suggests the Li + cations are constantly in motion on this disordered Li sublattice, implying that the b -Li2B12H12 polymorph is a potential Li + superionic conductor. Such phases are well known in the tertiary Li containing hydrides, 13 and the Li2B12H12 system may now offer a new and novel Li + ion conductor, whose transition temperature may be engineered through the addition of halides.

Fig. S2 and Table S1 (ESI†). It should be noted that this is an average structural model that is conceptually similar to earlier work 10 based on neutron diffraction data of Cs2B12H12. Due to the poor scattering from Li, B and H with X-rays, further research should be undertaken with neutrons to completely elucidate the structural model, although this would require isotopic 7 Li2 11 B12D12. The b -Li2B12H12 polymorph exists over a wide temperature range, ca. 355-550 1 C, and during this period, significant H loss occurs from the sample, as observed from the TPD-MS in Fig. 1b. H loss through the transition at 355 1 C is minor, but after 400 1 C, significant H loss occurs, and the b -Li2B12H12 polymorph decomposes directly to the nanocrystalline H-poor g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x polymorph, which diffracts with a broad halo in the 5.85-7.00 Å d -spacing range, dependent on the amount of H released. 3

The heavy group I dodecahydrocloso -dodecaborates M2B12H12 (M = K, Rb, Cs) all reside in the Fm % 3 space group at room temperature with cations occupying an 8c (0.25, 0.25, 0.25) site between B12H12 2 /C0 anions. The space group symmetry is related to the cation size and both Na2B12H12 ( P 21/ n ) and Li2B12H12 ( Pa % 3) exist in different space groups at room temperature. For M2B12H12 (M = K, Rb, Cs), the B12H12 2 /C0 anion centre to cation distance is always large enough (&gt;4.6 Å) to ensure that even with a second B12H12 2 /C0 motif, the minimum M-H distance is never violated. As such, the cation does not need to move due to shortened M-H separation, and a second order transition ensues. For disordered b -Li2B12H12, the B12H12 2 /C0 anion centre to Li + distance is significantly shorter ( ca. 4.1 Å), and with a second B12H12 2 /C0 motif, moderately shortened Li-H distances occur, which force Li off the static 8c position, producing a ''frustrated'' Li sublattice with average 25%occupancy on 8c and 24d. We also note that Na2B12H12 exhibits a short B12H12 2 /C0 anion centre to Na + distance ( ca. 4.2 Å), and as such we expect it to undergo a similar first order transition.

While the B12H12 2 /C0 reorientational disorder and Li + ionic conductivity is likely to persist in the H-poor g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x polymorph, this feature alone is likely insufficient to explain why the phase has become nanoscopic compared to the strongly crystalline a and b -Li2B12H12 polymorphs. The creation of the H-poor g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x polymorph is clearly related to H loss from Li2B12H12 and high resolution transmission electron microscopy may elucidate these unique microstructural details. However, light atom evaporation by electron ''knock on'' damage may preclude the use of Li, even at very low electron flux. 14 We note that Cs2B12H12 also decomposes to a similar H-poor Cs2B12H12 /C0 x phase that also diffracts with a broad halo, similar to g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x . On this basis, decomposed Cs2B12H12 /C0 x phase would be preferable for high resolution TEM studies to discern the nature of the feature delineating nanoscopic mosaics of Cs2B12H12 /C0 x . The nanoscopic nature of the H-poor g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x polymorph is also the major reason why the LiBH4 decomposition process has only recently been clearly elucidated for the first time. 3

Our findings strongly suggest that the thermodynamics for the decomposition of LiBH4 to the g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x polymorph 3 must be reassessed, and that the entropy component of the order-disorder transition in Li2B12H12 must be included. For example, such entropic features are the origin of the failure to correctly predict the high temperature hexagonal polymorph of LiBH4 by density functional theory. 7 Further in situ studies such as neutron diffraction, quasi-elastic neutron scattering and 7 Li spin-lattice relaxation by solid state NMR will yield more details on the complex interplay of B12H12 2 /C0 reorientational disorder and Li + conductivity in the Li2B12H12 system.

## Conclusions

Li2B12H12 thermally decomposes under vacuum via a previously unobserved discontinuous first-order phase transformation at ca. 355 1 C. This transformation displays an order-disorder entropic process, consistent with reorientational disordering of the icosahedral B12H12 2 /C0 anion, and Li + conductivity. It also displays the symmetry preserving features of an isosymmetric transformation. During the transition, the unit cell volume expands by ca. 8.7%. Commensurate with H release, the b -Li2B12H12 polymorph decomposes to a nanoscopic H-poor g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x phase. Presently it is not possible to discern the nature of the microstructural feature that delineates the nanoscopic mosaics of g -Li2B12H12 /C0 x . All thermodynamic modeling related to LiBH4 and Li2B12H12 decomposition must be modified to include the entropic reorientational disordering of the icosahedral B12H12 2 /C0 anion and Li + conductivity.
