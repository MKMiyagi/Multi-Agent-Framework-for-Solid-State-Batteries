## Abstract:

Sodium-ion solid electrolytes offer a sustainable route toward next-generation batteries, but few match the performance of lithium counterparts. Halide-based NaMOCl4 (M = Nb, Ta) has recently emerged  as  a  promising  analogue  to  LiMOCl4,  yet  its  structure-transport  relationships  remain unclear due to poor crystallinity in experiments. Here, we combine density functional theory and machine-learned molecular dynamics to reveal that crystalline NaMOCl4 exhibits negligible roomtemperature conductivity, with high activation barriers arising from vacancy-mediated diffusion below an order-disorder transition. Above this transition, rotational and translational motion of the MO2/2Cl4 chains creates new Na sites and enhances transport. In contrast, the amorphous phase inherently supports facile, three-dimensional Na diffusion through dynamic framework flexibility. These results show that ordered crystalline phases hinder ionic transport, while disorder -either thermally induced or structural -facilitates it, revising prior assumptions from the Li system and providing design principles for high-conductivity Na halide electrolytes.

## Introduction

The growing demand for  electric  vehicles  and  grid-scale  storage  has  amplified  concerns  over lithium supply constraints, motivating the search for alternative battery chemistries 1 . Sodium-ion batteries  are  a  promising  complement to lithium-based systems, leveraging  the abundance and lower cost of sodium 2  while enabling safer, energy-dense designs through the use of inorganic solid electrolytes 3 .

Despite significant progress in lithium-based solid electrolytes -many achieving roomtemperature ionic conductivities above 10 mS/cm 4 -far fewer high-performing sodium analogues have been identified. One intrinsic challenge is the larger ionic radius of Na + (~1.02 Å) relative to Li +  (~0.76 Å), which often disrupts the fast ion-transport pathways in frameworks optimized for lithium 5 .  For  example,  the  conductivity  of  close-packed  halides  such  as  Li2ZrCl6  and  Li3-xY1xZrxCl6, drops by more than an order of magnitude upon Na substitution 6 -9 .

Recently, halide-based Na electrolytes such as NaMOCl4 (M = Nb, Ta) have been reported with conductivities up to ~1 mS/cm 10,11 , mirroring the composition yet falling short of their highperforming  Li  analogues,  LiMOCl4 12 ,  which  reach  up  to  12  mS/cm 12,13 .  NaMOCl4 compounds exhibit poor crystallinity, with NaTaOCl4 (NTOC) reported as nearly fully amorphous 10,11 , making it difficult to assess whether the crystalline phase of NaMOCl4 resembles that of its Li analogue. While LiMOCl4 compounds are also partially amorphous, their X-ray diffraction patterns show clearer crystalline features, enabling indexing to a reference structure 13 -15 .  Nazar et al. demonstrated that ionic conductivity in LiNbOCl4 is limited by its amorphous fraction, implying the crystalline phase has the higher ion transport 13 . In particular, high conductivity in crystalline LiMOCl4 has been attributed to dynamic, correlated interactions between Li +  and the MO2/2Cl4 polyhedral framework 16 .

Whether NaMOCl4 exhibits similar structure-transport relationships remains unclear. To date,  no  direct  comparison  between  its  crystalline  and  amorphous  phases  has  been  reported, making it difficult to determine which governs ionic transport. Given the parallels with the  Li system, it is plausible that the amorphous structure also impedes Na-ion transport. This hypothesis, if validated, could guide strategies for improving conductivity in this family of solid electrolytes.

In this study, we present a combined computational investigation of the crystalline and amorphous phases of NaMOCl4 (M = Nb, Ta), comparing their structural features and ion transport behavior.  We  find  that,  unlike  the  Li  analogues,  the  crystalline  phase  exhibits  poor  roomtemperature  ionic  conductivity  due  to  an  order-disorder  transition  above  ~500  K,  whereas  the amorphous phases exhibit low Na +  activation energies (0.19 -0.20 eV). These results revise prior assumptions based on the Li system, suggesting that, unlike LiMOCl4 where amorphization limits performance, the crystalline NaMOCl4 phase itself may be the bottleneck. This insight highlights the potential of engineered disorder to enhance Na-ion transport in halide electrolytes.

## Structure of crystalline and amorphous NaMOCl4

Depicted in Fig. 1a-c, crystalline NaNbOCl4 (c-NNOC) is for our study assumed to be analogous to  the  Li  analogue 12,16 ,  with  one-dimensional  chains  of  corner-O-sharing  NbO2/2Cl4  octahedra along the a -direction (in-chain direction). Along the b and c (out-of-chain) directions, these chains are van der Waals bonded, with sodium ions occupying the void space between them. We adopt essentially the same structure for crystalline NaTaOCl4 (c-NTOC). As computed with the r 2 SCAN meta-GGA functional, the relaxed c-NNOC and c-NTOC structures have energies above hull of 11.6 and 9.9 meV/atom, respectively, calculated using all competing phases from the Materials Project database to construct the convex hull 17,18 . These values are within the energy range typically found for existing inorganic crystalline phases 19 , suggesting that the structure may be synthetically accessible. The primitive cell shown in Fig. 1a-c was obtained by quenching a room-temperature MD-sampled configuration, and it represents the lowest-energy structure identified in this study. In addition, alternative chain arrangements differing in b-c plane registry and a -axis alignment were found to be within 4-6 meV/atom of this configuration (Fig. S1-S2).

The amorphous phase (Fig. 1d) was obtained by starting from the crystalline phase and adopting  a  melt-quench  approach 20 using  the  on-the-fly  molecular  dynamics  (MD)  framework implemented  within  the  Vienna  Ab-initio  Simulation  Package  (VASP).  The  temperature  was gradually raised to 2000 K, where melting was observed, after which the system was equilibrated, cooled to 0 K, and finally relaxed to a local energy minimum (see SI-Methods for details). The structure shown in Fig. 1d is a snapshot from an equilibrated MD trajectory in a 2 √2 x 2 √2 x 2 supercell, containing approximately 1300 atoms. On average, each Nb/Ta atom is coordinated by about six anions in the first coordination shell (~4 Cl and ~1.8 O), as determined by integrating the particle density up to the minimum after the first peak of the radial distribution function (Note S1, Fig. S3). As depicted in Fig. 1d, the amorphous structure consists of distorted chain fragments of Ta/NbOxCly polyhedral units that share oxygen vertices with each other. Na +  ions occupy the interstitial space between these Ta/NbOxCly fragments.

The  thermodynamic  competition  between  the  crystalline  and  amorphous  phases  was assessed by computing the energy above hull for 40 DFT-relaxed structures sampled from 1000 K amorphous-phase MD trajectories and comparing them to crystalline counterparts (Fig. S4). The lowest-energy amorphous NNOC and NTOC structures lie 62.9 and 44.9 meV/atom above the convex hull, compared to 11.6 and 9.9 meV/atom for the crystalline phases. As discussed by Aykol et al. 21 ,  the  amorphous-limit energy varies widely across chemistries, typically from 50 to 500 meV/atom above the hull. The amorphous NNOC and NTOC phases fall near the lower end of this range,  suggesting  that  the  amorphous  and  crystalline  phases  are  in  close  thermodynamic competition, consistent with the low crystallinity observed experimentally 10,11 . The smaller energy difference  between  a-NTOC  and  c-NTOC  compared  to  the  NNOC  pair  provides  a  plausible explanation for the greater degree of amorphization reported for NTOC in experimental studies 10,11 .

## Ionic conductivity in Na(Ta/Nb)OCl4

To evaluate Na-ion transport in both crystalline and amorphous phases of Na(Ta/Nb)OCl4, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 K for at least 5 ns. Interatomic forces were described using the machine-learned interatomic potential (MLIP) CHGNet 22 , which was fine-tuned separately for each composition and phase using DFT reference data generated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the D3 van der Waals  correction 23,24 .  The  resulting  MLIPs  achieved  low  mean  absolute  errors  in  energies  (1 meV/atom and 5 meV/atom for crystalline and amorphous phases, respectively), forces (~43-44 meV/Å for both phases), and stresses (~0.03 and 0.06 GPa for crystalline and amorphous phases, respectively) (Note S2, Table S2-S3), providing confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the MLIP-MD simulations.

Fig.  2  presents  Arrhenius  plots  for  the  Na-ion  diffusivity  in  crystalline  and  amorphous Na(Ta/Nb)OCl4,  denoted  c-N[N,T]OC  and  a-N[N,T]OC,  respectively.  In  both  crystalline NaNbOCl4 (c-NNOC, Fig. 2a) and NaTaOCl4 (c-NTOC, Fig. 2b), we observe a distinct low- and high-temperature activation energy. The transition between them occurs at 500 K for c-NTOC and between  550-650  K  for  c-NNOC.  Above  the  transition,  both  materials  exhibit  low  activation energies:  0.19±0.02  eV  for  c-NNOC  and  0.17±0.01  eV  for  c-NTOC,  comparable  to  AIMDsimulated values for LiNbOCl4 (0.23 eV) and LiTaOCl4 (0.18 eV) 16 . In the transition regime of cNNOC,  the  activation  energy  increases  to  0.42±0.03  eV.  However,  below  the  transition,  the activation  energies  rise  sharply  to  0.95  ±  0.04  eV  (c-NNOC)  and  1.40  ±  0.05  eV  (c-NTOC), resulting in room temperature ionic conductivities on the order of 10 -7 -10 -5  mS/cm, several orders of magnitude lower than the experimental values reported for Na(Nb/Ta)OCl4 10,11 . This suggests that, unlike in the Li analogues where the crystalline phase dominates transport, the high ionic conductivity  observed  experimentally  in  Na(Nb/Ta)OCl4  is  unlikely  to  originate  from  the crystalline phase.

In contrast, the amorphous phases of NNOC and NTOC (Fig. 2c) exhibits low activation energy  of  0.19-0.20  eV  across  the  entire  simulated  temperature  range,  yielding  high  roomtemperature  ionic  conductivities  of  8.99  mS/cm  and  9.36  mS/cm,  respectively.  These  values exceed  the  experimentally  reported  conductivities  of  NNOC  (1.2  mS/cm)  and  NTOC  (1.5 mS/cm) 10,11 .

Dashed  lines  represent  extrapolated  Arrhenius  fits.  In  (a)-(b),  three  fits  are  shown corresponding  to  temperatures  below  (teal),  within  (light  blue),  and  above  (dark  orange)  the transition regime. The transition temperature window is highlighted by the grey shaded region and labeled in the plot. Most error bars in (a)-(c) are smaller than the marker size, indicating high statistical confidence in the diffusivity estimates at each temperature.

## Structural characterization of crystalline NaNbOCl4

Due to the sharp increase in activation energy at the transition temperature, the ionic conductivity of c-NNOC and c-NTOC decreases rapidly below this temperature (550-650 K for NNOC and 500 K for NTOC). To characterize and better understand the transition, we present qualitative and quantitative analyses in Fig. 3, using c-NNOC as a representative system.

Snapshots  of  c-NNOC  with  overlaid  Na  probability  densities  below  and  above  the transition  (Fig.  3a-b)  reveal  substantial  differences  in  both  Na  site  distribution  and  framework geometry. At 450 K (Fig. 3a), Na +  ions occupy a single type of site between NbO2/2Cl4 chains, exhibiting  restricted  back-and-forth  motion  primarily  along  the b -axis.  These  sites  are  fully occupied, requiring vacancy formation for long-range diffusion. The framework remains relatively rigid, with NbO2/2Cl4 octahedra aligned into nearly linear chains connected by shared O atoms. The four Cl atoms surrounding each Nb undergo small-amplitude librations about the chain axis (Fig. S5-a). In a static snapshot (Fig. 3a), these librations manifest as slight rotational offsets of Cl positions along the a -axis and subtle tilting of the octahedral chains.

At 650 K (Fig. 3b), pronounced disorder emerges in both octahedral orientations and Naion  distribution.  Whereas  at  450  K  each  octahedron  is  bordered  by  two  Na  positions  aligned approximately along the c -axis, six equivalent sites appear at 650 K, forming a nearly hexagonal ring around each octahedron. This reorganization, facilitated by an ~8% expansion of the b -axis, effectively doubles the number of accessible Na sites (yellow hotspots in Fig. 3b), leading to partial site  occupancy  and  shorter  distances  between  adjacent  sites.  Concurrently,  the  NbO2/2Cl4 octahedra exhibit orientational disorder within and between chains, with Nb-Cl bonds adopting a continuous distribution of orientations as Cl probability densities span 360° around each Nb site (Fig. S5-b). The chains also become buckled, with increased tilting between successive octahedra (Fig. 3b, inset). This combination of polyhedral disorder and emergent Na sites marks the onset of the order-disorder transition in c-N(N/T)OC.

To quantify this transition, we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient &lt;Cij&gt; between the axes of nearest-neighbor octahedra within each chain (intra-chain) and between adjacent chains (inter-chain).  The  space-  and  time-averaged  &lt;Cij&gt;  values  for  NNOC  are  shown  in  Fig.  3c (analogous results for NTOC in Fig. S6). Below the transition (teal region), &lt;Cij&gt; values remain close to 1, indicating strong orientational alignment of the octahedra. As temperature increases, &lt;Cij&gt; decreases gradually, then drops sharply near the transition (gray region), consistent with the onset of disorder in both polyhedral orientation and Na site occupancy. The temperature-dependent &lt;Cij&gt; trend parallels the changes in ionic conductivity, both exhibiting a distinct shift across the transition. At all temperatures, inter-chain &lt;Cij&gt; values exceed intra-chain values, indicating that orientational disorder is more pronounced within chains than between them.

Above the transition, the NbO2/2Cl4 chains exhibit both rotational motion and translation along the chain axis, resulting in a finite mean squared displacement (MSD) for Nb and O atoms. Fig. 3d shows the MSD of Nb below (&lt; 550 K), within (550-650 K), and above (&gt;= 650 K) the transition. A clear onset of translational motion appears only above the transition, where the MSD rises significantly with time. This combined rotational and translational mobility of the MO2/2Cl4 (M = Nb, Ta) framework has not been reported in LiMOCl4 but resembles polymer electrolytes in which chain motion cooperatively enhances cation transport 25 -27 .

## Ionic conductivity mechanism in crystalline NaTaOCl4

The  combined  rotational  and  translational  mobility  of  the  NbO2/2Cl4  chains  introduces  new structural degrees of freedom at high temperatures. To investigate how these dynamics affect Naion transport, we analyze the Na probability densities from molecular dynamics trajectories and apply Boltzmann inversion to construct temperature-dependent free energy landscapes. Specifically, we use the approximate relation 𝐹(𝑥) = -𝑘𝐵𝑇𝑙𝑛(𝑃(𝑥)) ,  where P(x) is the timeaveraged spatial occupancy of Na 28,29 . In Fig. 4a-b, the free energy landscape is computed on a 0.5 x  0.5  x  0.5  Å 3 grid  and  visualized  along  the b -c , a -c ,  and a -b planes  at  450  K  and  550  K, corresponding to temperatures below and above the NTOC transition temperature (~500 K).

At 450 K (Fig. 4a), Na migration is observed primarily in the b -c and a -b planes. The freeenergy map shows distinct minima separated by high-energy regions, indicating that ion motion proceeds via hopping between well-defined sites with limited connectivity. At 550 K (Fig. 4b), the landscape becomes more continuous, with new migration pathways emerging in the a -c plane and a low-energy channel forming along the a -axis, driven by the translational motion of the TaO2/2Cl4 chains.

To quantify the energy landscape more broadly, we construct histograms of free energy values across all grid points visited by Na atoms (Fig. 4c-d). At 450 K (Fig. 4c), the distribution is dominated by high-energy voxels (white-red), indicating that Na ions must often traverse steep energy  barriers  to  reach  low-energy  sites.  At  550  K  (Fig.  4d),  the  distribution  becomes  more homogenized, with a greater number of intermediate-energy voxels (purple-yellow). This indicates that  Na  atoms  can  move  through  a  larger  number  of  moderate-energy  pathways  at  higher temperatures, reducing the overall energy barrier for diffusion and contributing to enhanced ionic mobility.

## Origin of high ionic conductivity in amorphous NaTaOCl4

Evaluating the precise mechanism that facilitates Na hopping is more challenging in an amorphous structure due to the variety of environments and possible correlated motion between anions and cations 30 . To analyze many-particle correlations, we evaluate the mean cross-displacement (MCD), shown in Fig. 5a for NaTaOCl4 at T = 700 K. The MCD captures the distinct-particle terms entering the Onsager transport coefficients 31 , and its sign indicates whether particles move in a correlated (positive), anticorrelated (negative), or uncorrelated (zero on average) manner (see SI-Methods for definition). As shown in Fig. 5a, the MCDs for Ta-Cl and Ta-O are strictly positive, indicating that Ta atoms and anions tend to move in the same direction. This is supported by Fig. S7, showing that  all  O  atoms  remain  within  3  Å  of  Ta  throughout  the  MD  simulations,  and  by  the  nearly identical  MCD  curves  for  Na-Ta  and  Na-O,  indicating  the  nature  of  the  Na-Ta  and  Na-O interaction is the same. These results show evidence that Ta atoms drift while confined to their surrounding anion cages, and no escape of Ta from its anion polyhedra is observed. In contrast, the MCD between Na and Ta indicates anticorrelated motion between the two cations, which is consistent with the electrostatic repulsion expected between positively charged cations 32 .

As  shown  in  Fig.  1d,  the  amorphous  phase  of  Na(Ta/Nb)OCl4  displays  chains  of interconnected polyhedra. The average number of Ta chains of a given length, determined from analyzing snapshots extracted every 50 ps from the MD trajectory at T = 700 K, is shown in Fig. 5b.  The  distribution  peaks  at  short-to-intermediate  lengths:  chains  of  3-4  Ta  units  are  most frequent, while isolated polyhedra are rare. A moderate number of long chains, extending up to 17 units, are also observed. The small error bars -representing the standard deviation of the chain counts -indicate  minimal  fluctuation  in  chain  connectivity  across  the  analyzed  snapshots, confirming that these extended Ta-O/Cl networks predominantly remain connected throughout the simulation  and  form  the  amorphous  matrix  the  Na  ions  diffuse  within.  The  inset  of  Fig.  5b illustrates a representative eight-member Ta chain composed of corner-sharing polyhedra linked by bridging anions.

Fig. 5c shows the probability density of Na +  ions obtained from the MD trajectory at 700 K. In contrast to the crystalline phase, regions of high Na + probability density are not confined to well-defined sites but are instead distributed throughout the interstitial space between Ta-O/Cl chains, forming a continuous three-dimensional diffusion network.

Unlike the crystalline phase, which undergoes a superionic phase transition and deviates from linear Arrhenius behavior, the amorphous phase of Na(Ta/Nb)OCl4 shows no such transition and follows a linear Arrhenius trend across the investigated temperature range. As shown in Fig. S8,  the  amorphous  phase  exhibits  persistent  Ta  mobility  even  below  the  superionic  transition temperature of the crystalline phase. To directly assess how Ta-chain motion affects Na diffusion, we perform a virtual experiment in which we supplement the atomic forces exerted on Ta atoms with a fictitious isotropic Hookean restoring force to constrain the Ta atoms toward their positions at t =0 of the MD run. The constraint not only suppresses translational motion of the Ta chains but also limits rotational freedom of the surrounding Cl atoms (Fig. S9). This allows us to interpolate between  the  high-mobility  regime  of  Ta  chains  in  the  amorphous  phase  and  the  frozen-chain behavior of the low-temperature crystalline phase. Fig. 5d displays the results of these simulations for different values of the Hookean spring α , and shows that Na diffusion decreases systematically with  increasing  spring  constant α .  These  results  demonstrate  that  the  mobility  of  Ta  chains  is critical for fast Na diffusion in the amorphous phase.

## Discussion

Experimental  synthesis  of  Na(Nb/Ta)OCl4  has  yielded  samples  with  low  crystallinity  or  fully amorphous phases 10,11 . However, these samples lacked an annealing step, which was necessary to crystallize the Li(Nb/Ta)OCl4  materials 12,13 .  In  LiNbOCl4,  enhancing  crystallinity  through controlled  annealing  and  ball-milling  conditions  was  shown  to  improve  ionic  conductivity, suggesting  that  the  amorphous  phase  is  the  limiting  component.  Extrapolating  from  the  Li analogue, one might expect greater crystallinity to similarly enhance NaMOCl4 conductivity. Our modeling  results  challenge  this  assumption.  Simulated  crystalline  NNOC  and  NTOC  exhibit negligible Na-ion conductivity at room temperature, with activation barriers of 0.95 and 1.4 eV, respectively (Fig. 2a-b). These high barriers result  from an order-disorder transition occurring between 500 and 650 K, below which the framework remains rigid and Na diffusion is limited by the absence of vacancies.

The order-disorder transition in crystalline N(N/T)OC involves both the emergence of new Na sites and increased flexibility of the MO2/2Cl4 framework. Above the transition, the MO2/2Cl4 chains  acquire  rotational  and  translational  mobility,  forming  a  six-site  Na  cluster  around  each MO2/2Cl4 octahedron with reduced intersite distances (Fig. 3b). The rotational alignment between neighboring octahedra becomes strongly perturbed, particularly along the chain direction, while chain translation flattens the potential landscape for Na diffusion (Fig. 3d). In the free energy maps (Fig. 4), these effects manifest as continuous low-energy channels along the a -axis and smoother, moderate-energy pathways across the a -b , bc , and a -c planes.

This behavior is reminiscent of the soft-cradle effect observed in LiNbOCl4 and similar materials,  where  anion-framework  flexibility  couples  with  cation  transport  to  lower  energy barriers 4,13,33,34 .  In  NaMOCl4,  this  coupling  is  further  amplified  by  the  additional  translational freedom of the octahedral chains. The transition from discrete hopping sites to a smoother freeenergy landscape enables Na ions to migrate along continuous, moderate-energy pathways rather than via high-energy hops between isolated sites, accounting for the enhanced ionic mobility in the high-temperature crystalline phase.

We find that the amorphous phase can be viewed as a highly distorted analogue of the crystalline  structure,  where  the  polyhedral  chains  are  shortened  and  adopt  bent,  irregular geometries (Fig. 1d and Fig. 5b). These pronounced chain distortions likely underlie the observed diffuse, liquid-like Na probability density, which forms a 3D-connected network of low-energy migration  pathways  rather  than  discrete  hopping  sites  (Fig.  5c).  The  structural  features  that facilitate conduction in the high-temperature crystalline phase, like enhanced framework flexibility and  non-linear  chain  arrangements,  are  inherently  present  in  the  amorphous  phase.  This  local structural resemblance likely explains why the activation barrier in the amorphous phase (0.190.20 eV) is comparable to that of the high-temperature crystalline phase (0.17-0.19 eV).

The bent chain geometries in the amorphous phase resemble the types of distortions that temporarily  reduce  alignment  within  a  chain,  consistent  with  the  lower  intra-chain  correlation coefficients observed in the crystalline phase at elevated temperatures (Fig. 3c). The prominence of intra-chain disorder suggests that the onset temperature of the transition may depend on how easily the NbO2Cl4 or TaO2Cl4 octahedra distort within the one-dimensional chains. Indeed, our analysis  of  amorphous  NaTaOCl4  reveals  that  Na  mobility  is  highly  sensitive  to  the  rototranslational motion of the Ta-centered polyhedral chains (Fig. 5d). When artificial constraints are applied to Ta atoms, Na diffusivity is dramatically reduced, confirming that framework flexibility plays  a  critical  role  in  enabling  transport.  This  behavior  aligns  with  broader  observations  in

disordered ion conductors, where dynamic rearrangements of the host lattice flatten the energy landscape and promote rapid ion migration 35 -37 .

At low temperatures, full Na site occupancy (Fig. 3a) in the crystalline phase means that the measured activation energy reflects both migration and vacancy formation energies. The local migration barrier can be approximated from the free-energy landscape (Fig. 4a) as the difference between the saddle point and equilibrium sites, yielding a value of 0.32 eV for crystalline NTOC at 450 K. This suggests that the low conductivity of crystalline Na(Nb/Ta)OCl4 is primarily limited by the absence of Na vacancies and could likely be improved through the introduction of extrinsic vacancies. However, the high oxidation states of Nb 5+  and Ta 5+  restrict viable dopants to the few elements that can achieve +6 valence. Furthermore, because oxygen plays an important role in connecting the polyhedra into chains, substituting it with a lower-valent  anion to decrease Na content is unlikely.

In mixed-phase systems, the slowest phase often limits overall conductivity unless there is continuous percolation through the fast-conducting component. Our simulations suggest that the crystalline  phase  is  likely  to  act  as  this  bottleneck  due  to  its  low  room  temperature  ionic conductivity. Experimental measurements reported activation energies around ~0.31 eV 10,11  which is in between what we find for the low-T crystalline and amorphous phases, which may reflect the mixed phase nature of experimental samples. We note that reported activation energies closely match the 0.32 eV local migration barrier approximated from the free energy landscape. This may lead one to speculate that the experimental conductivity originates from a crystalline framework containing extrinsic vacancies introduced during metastable synthesis, such as high-energy ball milling. While the crystalline phase limits ionic conductivity, the presence of vacancies  would mitigate this effect, leading to a more moderate activation energy. Nonetheless, this also imposes a lower bound on achievable performance: even with extrinsic defects, it may be difficult to reduce activation barriers below ~0.3 eV in crystalline N(N/T)OC without shifting the order-disorder transition to lower temperatures.

Taken together, our results offer a revised perspective on ionic transport in Na(Nb/Ta)OCl4. Unlike in the Li analogues, the crystalline phase does not inherently enable fast ion conduction unless thermally activated or structurally disordered. Instead, the amorphous and high-temperature disordered crystalline phases facilitate fast Na-ion transport through a combination of framework flexibility and expanded site connectivity. These insights emphasize the need to design materials with low transition temperatures, intrinsic structural disorder, or fully amorphous frameworks to promote high ionic conductivity at ambient conditions. Such strategies may include selecting compositions that destabilize the ordered phase or identifying frameworks with inherent dynamic flexibility to bypass the need for a high-temperature transition altogether. More broadly, this work highlights the critical role of framework dynamics in enabling fast ion transport and provides guiding principles for the design of next-generation Na-based halide solid electrolytes. This work also provides another example demonstrating that principles for high Liion  conductivity  do  not  necessarily  translate  to  Na-ion  conduction,  similar  to  what  has  been observed in cathode materials 38 .
