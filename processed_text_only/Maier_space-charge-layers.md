In this paper we present a set of simple analytical solutions for the parallel and the serial contributions of space charge zones to the overall conduction in bicrystals and (brick layered) ceramics for a variety of situations. The different situations are characterized by signs of the space charge potential, by different charge numbers of the carriers and by the presence or absence of acceptor or donor dopants. We can give solutions for arbitrary charge numbers as long as we restrict to sufficiently high space charge potentials and can presuppose equilibrium for the mobile carriers. A recent analysis of impedance measurements of nanocrystalline ceria based on a space charge model is briefly mentioned as a specific example, as it reflects the occurrence of highly n-conducting accumulation layers in addition to strongly blocking oxygen vacancy depletion layers.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years the demand for a better knowledge of the interfacial contribution to the overall conductivity of electroceramic materials has been rapidly growing, 1,2 and may have reached a culmination point in the consideration of nanocrystalline materials. In these materials the conduction behavior likely becomes interfacially controlled due to the extremely high density of the interface (grain boundary). 3-6

Quantitative defect models in space charge zones of polycrystalline ionic and mixed conductors were introduced by Maier, and verified by this group and others for a number of halide systems (see, refs. 7 and 8 and references cited therein). There is also an extended literature on grain boundary effects in oxide materials such as Fe-doped SrTiO3 , 9,10 Y-doped ZrO2 11 and CeO2 . 5,6,12 In these oxides the space charge potential has been shown to have eminent consequences on electronic and ionic transport properties. A very clear example is the deconvolution of partial conductivities in nanocrystalline ceria as recently demonstrated by Kim and Maier which will be briefly outlined at the end of this paper. The enhanced n-type conductivity of nanocrystalline ceria was found by Chiang et al , 4 and first analyzed in terms of space charge by Tschoepe 5 following ref. 7.

In this paper we briefly describe the interfacial conductivity properties of this prototype mixed conductor and give a collection of simple relevant results for the space charge conductance for various cases. In sections 2-3 we essentially summarize the description of space charge conductivity in simple cases following earlier work. 7,8 Then we deal with more complex situations in which the charge carrier posses different absolute charge numbers and/or in which the electrical profile is mixture of Gouy-Chapman and Mott-Schottky situations.

## 2. Defect concentration profiles in the space charge zones

According to the constancy of the electrochemical potential ( i.e. @ ~ m jx / @ x ¼ 0 for the one-dimensional problem, where ~ m j ¼ m j + zje f with m and f being the chemical and the electrostatic potential, respectively) for any mobile charge carrier j , the concentration profile ( z ; concentration relative to the bulk value) follows

where Df ( x ) is the electrical potential relative to the bulk (subscript 1 ). The symbols c , z , e , k B and T have their usual meanings. Eqn. (1) assumes dilute defects, i.e. presupposes the absence of their interactions and ignores the finite size. It is also assumed that there are no structural variations up to the boundary value ( x ¼ 0). Since the rhs of eqn. (1) is independent of j , it immediately holds for two charge carriers j ¼ 1, 2 with the charge numbers z 1 and z 2 that:

The calculation of the defect concentration profiles implies the knowledge of the electrical potential profile (eqn. (1)), and additionally the relationship between concentration and electrical potential being given by Poisson's equation. Combining eqn. (1) and Poisson's equation, thus, leads to the PoissonBoltzmann differential equation:

where e is the dielectric constant (here spatial dependencies of e as well as magnetic effects are neglected).

## 2.1. Gouy-Chapman profiles

Let us begin with the case that only two equivalently charged defects of opposite signs (subscripts, + and /C0 ) are relevant

( z + ¼ /C0 z /C0 ¼ z ). The bulk concentrations are equal for reasons of electroneutrality ( c + ¼ c /C0 /C17 c 1 ). Assuming that the extent of the crystal ( d ) is large with respect to the screening length ( l ), given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

the solution of eqn. (3) for semi-infinite boundary conditions leads to the Gouy-Chapman profiles

/C18

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the parameter W is defined by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

W measures the ''degree of influence'' of the contact under consideration. 13 It becomes zero if the defect chemistry in the boundary layer does not deviate from that in the bulk i.e. z 0 ¼ 1. On the other hand it approaches +1 for maximum enrichment ( z 0 /C29 1) and /C0 1 for maximum depletion effect ( z 0 /C28 1).

Eqn. (5) together with eqn. (1) lead to the concentration profile,

/C18

/C19

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Large effects (| W | ! 1) mean that the space charge in Poisson's equation is determined by the enriched charge carrier only (let's assume c +); under these circumstances eqn. (3) can be directly integrated to yield the approximation 14

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Note that eqn. (8) is more general than eqn. (7) in that it makes no assumption concerning the charge of the counterdefect ( e.g. | z +| ¼ | z /C0 |); it is however (in contrast to eqn. (7)) restricted to large effects.

## 2.2. Mott-Schottky profiles

If one of two majority charge carriers ( e.g. a positively charged defect) is immobile such that its concentration profile is horizontal up to the interface ( z +0 ¼ 1) while the other is depleted, eqn. (8) is no longer valid. If we again neglect the depleted carrier in Poisson's equation ( i.e. charge density is constant and given by z + ec + 1 ), eqn. (3) becomes

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

which can be integrated with the boundary conditions ( f 0 ( l *) ¼ 0 and f ( l *) ¼ f 1 ) as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the width of the space charge zone, l *, is given by

Using eqn. (1) the concentration profile in the Mott-Schottky situation is obtained as (see e.g. ref. 15)

## 3. Space charge effects: Symmetric cases

For the sake of completeness of this work, let us first consider the pure parallel and series contributions of the space charge zones in a bicrystal in which the concentration profiles of two mobile charge carriers are symmetric (| z 1 | ¼ | z 2 | ¼ z , where the subscript 1 applies to the accumulated positive or negative defect and the subscript 2 refers to the corresponding counterdefect), following the approach taken by Maier. 7,8 The conductance parameter, Y k , that we have normalized with respect to the unimportant geometric parameters in the y - and z -directions, and that refers to the contribution parallel to the interface (superscript k ) (see Fig. 1) can be calculated as

Z

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the local conductivity s ( x ) is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

with u being the mobility.

Assuming l /C28 d , the integration of eqn. (13) results in 7

/C18

/C19

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the subscript sc denotes the space charge zone. This expression allows us to decompose the conductance into an effective thickness of the space charge zones and the effective concentration in there ( D c k sc ), namely into 2 l and c 1 2 W / (1 /C0 W ). For W 1 /C25 1 (maximum enrichment), the extra contribution of the space charge zone ( D Y k 1 ; 2sc ) to the total parallel conductance (which is given by the summation of the rhs term of eqn. (15) over 1 and 2) reduces to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

On the other hand, for large effects, the resistance, Z ? 1 ; 2 , integration over [ s ? m ( x )] /C0 1 1 ; 2 (see Fig. 1) and also free of geometric parameters, perpendicular to the interface (superscript ? ) follows 7 as

/C18

/C19

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where the latter quantity is given by the product of the effective parameters 2 l and 2 W / c 1 (1 + W ).

For W 2 /C25 /C0 1(maximum depletion), the extra resistance perpendicular to the interface could be simplified to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Let us for a moment consider its decomposition into bulk and space charge contributions. One possibility is the decomposition into bulk background (comprising the entire sample, i.e. Y k 1 and Z ? 1 ) and the superimposed space charge effect ( i.e. D Y k sc and D Z ? sc ). This is mathematically more efficient, independent of the definition of an effective thickness of the space charge zone, and corresponds to the Gibbs concept. A problem arises with respect to the definition of effective thicknesses and concentrations. In the case of the parallel conduction the excess concentration is the concentration to be added to the bulk background value. The definition is not straightforward for the perpendicular resistance effect. The calculation shows that Z ? can be decomposed into a bulk value and an additive excess term; however if we express D Z ? sc in terms of an effective concentration this is not the value to be added to c 1 since the concentration appears in the denominator. 7 In this case it might be more straightforward to decompose the resistance into the value of a spatial zone that does not include the space charge zone and the total resistance value of the latter, Z ? sc . This of course also can be done for the parallel conductance, Y k sc (in fact the effective concentrations used in ref. 5 refer to the latter definition). In the case of large effects on which we will focus (| W | ! 1), the bulk background does not play a role and the results coincide, i.e. D Y k sc ( D Z ? sc ) ffi Y k sc ( Z ? sc ) (see eqns. (16) and (18)). (The effective concentrations used in ref. 7 and ref. 5 for the just mentioned case can easily be transformed into each other via | W | + 1 /C25 2| W |). Hence in the following D Y k sc and D Z ? sc are used for the space charge contributions which have to be added to the bulk part. Whether or not we take into account a bulk background in the space charge zones will only be specified if it is of importance.

## 4. Space charge effects: Asymmetric and mixed cases

Let us now consider the situations in which the concentration profiles of two charge carriers are asymmetric. Then a general analytical solution for using W is not possible. In the following we will therefore concentrate on sufficiently large effects and use eqns. (8) and (12). In other words theses solutions presuppose that the charge density is approximately given by the non-depleted majority defect only. Eqns. (8) and (12) cannot be solutions at loci very distant from the interface which, however, do not decisively contribute to Y k sc or Z ? sc . A slightly better approximation in the Gouy-Chapman case might be using eqn. (7), which is strictly valid for z 1 ¼ /C0 z 2 , even for asymmetric situations 5 ( z 1 6¼/C0 z 2). While eqn. (8) ignores the counter defect completely, eqn. (7) then includes a correction of the correct sign. Note, however, that results based on such an approach also imply W /C25 1 in order to be quantitatively applicable.

Whereas eqn. (8) can be integrated directly yielding Y k sc according to eqn. (16) irrespective of z 2 , the evaluation of Z ? sc has to involve z 20 which now can be obtained by using eqn. (2):

For p /C17 z 2/ z 1 6¼/C0 1/2, the result is

!

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In case of p &lt; /C0 1/2, eqn. (19) reduces to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Interestingly enough Z ? 2 ; sc follows almost the bulk value

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

if p &lt; /C0 1/2. This is not so surprising, however, since in such cases the concentration profile of the charge carrier 1 is extremely steeply increased at the interface while the depletion of the other becomes relatively negligible. In such cases it is worth noting that the bulk background is included; otherwise the result ( D Z ? 2 ; sc ) could be close to zero.

Finally if p ¼ /C0 1/2

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Again the question whether or not the bulk background is taken into account, matters. Freeing eqn. (22) of the bulk background would lead to D Z ? 2 ; sc / ln( c 2 1 /2 c 20 ).

Although eqns. (20)-(23) as well as eqn. (16) are valid for any p value as long as | W | /C25 1, for the sake of simplicity we will, in this paper, limit our consideration of asymmetric cases only to those characterized by either 2 z 1 ¼ /C0 z 2 ( p ¼ /C0 2) or z 1 ¼ /C0 2 z 2 ( p ¼ /C0 1/2), which covers most of the relevant situations. (See concentration profiles b and c in Table 1). While eqn. (16) holds for Y k 1 ; sc in both cases, Z ? 1 ; sc for the case 2 z 1 ¼ /C0 z 2 follows from eqn. (20) as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

/C19

and for the case z 1 ¼ /C0 2 z 2 , from eqn. (22) as /C18

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where l / c /C0 1 = 2 2 1 .

Now we extend our consideration to the cases in which a dopant (denoted as the charge carrier 3), in addition to the carriers 1 and 2, exists as a majority charge carrier in the bulk, but does not contribute to the overall conductivity (due to either its low mobility just enough to allow for an equilibrium (Table 1d-i) or its completely negligible mobility (Table 1j-l)). As long as we presuppose a Gouy-Chapman profile for the dopant (Table 1d-l) and we refer to the majority counter defect in the bulk taken for calculating Y k 1 ; sc or Z ? 2 ; sc the dopant does not play any role (see Y k 1 ; sc in Table 1g-l and Z ? 2 ; sc in Table 1d,e). However if the mobile defect under consideration is the minority charge carrier in the bulk ( e.g. the carrier 1 in the cases of Table 1d,e or the carrier 2 in Table 1g-l) the parameters Y k 1 ; sc or Z k 2 ; sc should become dependent on c 3 1 since now l / c /C0 1 = 2 3 1 (see eqns. (16) and (18)). (In Table 1 Y k 1 ; sc and Z k 2 ; sc are described in terms of the measured effective conductivity, ( s k m)1 , and resistivity, ( r ? m ) 2 ( ¼ ( s ? m ) /C0 1 2 ), respectively, see eqn. (27). In the formulae compiled in Table 1 we used the relations c 3 1 ¼ | z 2/ z 3 | c 2 1 for Table 1d,e and c 3 1 ¼ | z 1/ z 3 | c 1 1 for Table 1g-l. Furthermore for Table 1d,e z 1 ¼ z 3 is further assumed).

So far we have obtained the effective concentration of the charge carriers 1 and 2 for the parallel conduction and the serial resistance in the situations with and without a dopant, but still in accordance with the Gouy-Chapman model as far as the enriched majority carrier (and hence the space charge dominating carrier) is considered.

If the dopant is immobile but nevertheless determines the space charge at the interface, we face the Mott-Schottky situation in which electrical potential profiles become a quadratic function of x (eqn. (12)). Assuming large effects, eqn. (10) can be linearized close to the interface and the integration over s k 1 ( x ) and s ? 1 ( x ) /C0 1 in the space charge zones (from x ¼ 0 to l *) leads to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

respectively.

The proportionality factors for the conductivity and the resistivity are (8/ d )| z 1 | eu 1 c 1 = 2 1 1 l and, (4/ d ) c 1 = 2 2 1 l /| z 2 | eu 2 , respectively, for the Gouy-Chapman (a-l) and combined cases (n-p).

In the cases of d, e and f z 1 ¼ z 3 is further assumed

One can meet more complicated situations if the space charge close to the interface becomes determined by the enriched minority charge carrier while the immobile dopant is still the majority defect at large distance from the interface (see n, o and p in Table 1). In such cases the concentration profiles of the defects can be approximated by the Gouy-Chapman profiles only in the region in which c 1 ( x ) &gt; c 3 1 (the profiles in the region where c 1 ( x ) &lt; c 3 1 follow a MottSchottky type of profile). It is, however, still an acceptable

approximation to consider the profiles as Gouy-Chapman profiles since for large effects only the region close to the interface ( x /C28 1) contributes to the integration. Y k 1 ; sc can thus be approximated to eqn. (16) and the integration over r ? 2 with eqn. (2) yields Z k 2 ; sc . Note that the formulae of Z k 2 ; sc in Table 1n-p (in terms of r ? 2 ) are rather general for Gouy-Chapman cases and reduce to those for the corresponding pure GouyChapman cases if c 1 1/C25 c 2 1 (see Table 1a-c).

As far as a polycrystalline (pc) ceramic is concerned, for which the brick layer model is a good approximation, we only have to multiply the above results by a geometrical factor to obtain effective space charge parameters, i.e. by 4 for s k m(pc) (see Fig. 2); !

respectively. If both accumulation (parallel boundaries) and depletion (perpendicular boundaries) are important, one can use ( j : volume fraction)

as a reasonable approximation as described in ref. 7. (It also allows for interpretation of impedance spectra as ^ s is the complex conductivity.) Such a case was realized with polycrystalline AgCl in which silver ions perceive both the highly conducting effect of the space charges but also the blocking effect of the interfacial core (constriction effect rather than space charge effect).

## 5. A specific example: nanocrystalline ceria

As mentioned earlier, one nice example in which we meet several of the above cases is given by the impedance experiments of nanocrystalline ceria (grain size about 30 nm) recently performed. 6 A slightly acceptor doped sample (0.15 mole% Gd) showed a large extra arc in a lower frequency range of the impedance spectra, a characteristic of the blocking grain boundaries (see Fig. 3a). Careful examination enabled to rule out possible causes ( e.g. an insulating impurity layer in the interface and/or porous grain boundaries) of such an arc other than the existence of serial depletion layers of oxygen vacancy in the vicinity of the interfacial core, which block the dc ionic current in the sample (Fig. 4). Moreover such a conclusion was strongly supported by the quantitative analyses (based on the Mott-Schottky model with a space charge potential of /C24 300 mV, see ref. 6 for detail) of the conductivity behavior under various oxygen partial pressures and temperatures, whose results were in excellent agreement with the model predictions for r ? m . On the other hand, the observed positive core charge will simultaneously lead to an accumulation of electrons in the space charge zones so that for purer samples the transition from the ionic to the electronic conduction may occur in such regions (see Table 1m, s k m). As a result, the parallel space

Fig. 4 The space charge model for nanocrystalline ceria; while for electronic conduction the parallel space charge zones bypass the bulk conductivity due to accumulation of electrons there (the mobility of the core charge is neglected), the ionic conduction should almost exclusively proceed along the bulk path as the space charge zones are strongly depleted of V /C15 /C15 O . Note, however, that for a long-range conduction of V /C15 /C15 O , extreme boundary resistances (due to the serial depletion zones) have to be overcome and thus will show up in the impedance spectrum as a separate low frequency arc.

charge zones are expected to bypass the bulk conductivity (see Fig. 4). Indeed for a nominally pure sample, only a high frequency arc was observed in the impedance spectra (see Fig. 3b) which showed n-type behavior. Again the partial electronic behavior of the sample separated from the total by using dc polarization measurements could be quantitatively explained by the Mott-Schottky model. The fact that we possibly are in the sub-Debye regime should not change the results too much, if we still refer to 2 l (and not to the grain size) as the virtual space charge thickness.

The electrical behavior which has been observed in nanocrystalline ceria is undesirable as far as solid electrolytes are concerned. How far it is possible to reverse the polarity of the core charge ( i.e. a negative D f (0)) in order to depress the electronic counterpart in favor of an accumulation of (doubly charged) oxygen vacancies in the space charge zones is still to be investigated (see Table 1l where z 1 ¼ +2, z 1 ¼ /C0 1). Directed tailoring of such a property, on the other hand, requires detailed information about the origin of the excess core charge which may be accessible only when the structure and chemistry of the grain boundaries are better understood.

## 5. Conclusions

Based on the space charge profiles which are valid for large accumulation or depletion effects, we gave analytical solutions for a variety of defect chemical situations. Such expressions make it possible to analyze the conductivity and resistivity of the samples experimentally obtained under different component partial pressures, temperatures and dopant concentrations. As an example, a recent analysis of the partial electronic and ionic conductivity behavior of nanocrystalline ceria was briefly set out.
