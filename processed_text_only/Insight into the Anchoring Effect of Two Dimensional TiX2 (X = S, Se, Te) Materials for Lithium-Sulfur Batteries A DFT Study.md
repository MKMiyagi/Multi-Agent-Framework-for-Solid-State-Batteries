It is desirable to develop suitable anchoring materials to refrain the notorious shuttle phenomenon in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), especially TiS2, with excellent physicochemical properties have attracted much attention. Here, in this work, density functional theory (DFT) computations were performed to systematically explore the adsorption behaviors of lithium polysul /uniFB01 des (LiPSs) over TiX2 (X = S, Se, Te) monolayer. It is concluded that TiS2 shows the best anchoring effect owing to the strongest adsorption energy. And it ' s found that the intrinsic structures of LiPSs after adsorption could be preserved by calculating the decomposition energy. Moreover, the low diffusion energy barrier of Li2S on TiS2 surface is expected to accelerate the kinetics during the charge/discharge process. Based on a series of calculations and discussion, we can theoretically demonstrate that TiS2, as an anchoring material, has advantages over TiSe2 and TiTe2 in enhancing Li-S batteries performance.

Rechargeable battery technology is booming, to solve the problems of energy crunch and environmental disruption resulted from the continuous exploitation and consumption of fossil fuels. Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have gained popularity in many /uniFB01 elds in the past decades, attributed to their high energy density, long cycle life, high conversion ef /uniFB01 ciency and no memory effect. 1 However, commercial Li-ion batteries were limited by the theoretical energy density (about 400 Wh kg -1 ). 2,3 With the rapid development of electric vehicles and smart grids, the intense contradiction between the ever-increasing energy demand of modern society and the limited energy density of traditional Li-ion batteries has been highlighted. In this context, scientists tried to explore different battery systems that can provide higher capacity. Eventually, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries were considered as a promising alternative to lithium-ion batteries among various existing electrochemical energy-storage devices. 2,4,5 The high theoretical capacity, high cost-effectiveness and low toxicity of the sulfur cathode make the commercial applications of Li-S batteries very appealing. Nevertheless, Li-S batteries have a plethora of drawbacks that severely hinder their practical use. 6 -8 (i) The ' shuttle effect ' of lithium polysul /uniFB01 des (LiPSs). High-order lithium polysul /uniFB01 des (Li2Sn, n = 4, 6 or 8) generated during the reaction could be dissolved in the electrolyte, and keep shuttling between the cathode and anode affected by the concentration gradient. It would result in rapid capacity degeneration and inferior Coulombic ef /uniFB01 ciency. (ii) The insulating property of sulfur and its /uniFB01 nal solid products (Li2S2 and Li2S). The resulting low utilization of active substances is not conducive to the speci /uniFB01 c capacity of the batteries. (iii) Large volumetric effect. The volume change of cathode up to 80%, issues in rupture of the electrodes and poor stability of the batteries.

A number of strategies have been put forward to address those aforementioned issues, especially the ' shuttle effect, ' for instance, the introduction of novel sulfur host materials, 9 -11 coated membranes, 12,13 functional interlayers, 14,15 and electrolyte additives. 16 -18 The main purpose is to enhance the interaction of LiPSs with the introduced materials, and to restrict the soluble LiPSs within the cathode side ef /uniFB01 ciently. As a whole, there are two main methods to strengthen the anchoring effect commonly employed: surface modi /uniFB01 cation and adoption of innovative two-dimensional (2D) materials. Researchers have expressed strong interest in the new 2D materials because of their unique electronic structure, physical and chemical properties, such as large speci /uniFB01 c surface area and high conductivity. 19,20 These materials could be utilized as sulfur hosts to physically or chemically constrain LiPSs so as to restrain their outward diffusion, thereby improving the cycle stability and energy ef /uniFB01 ciency of the batteries. For example, carbon nitrides show better anchor behaviors for LiPSs than graphene. 21,22 Zhang et al. 23 summarized the application of 2D MXenes materials in Li-S batteries, showing good polysul /uniFB01 de anchoring behavior and catalytic performance both theoretically and experimentally. Zhang et al. 24 systematically explored the adsorption of LiPSs on a new kind of 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials, indicating that V-HAB-CP could be a promising candidate cathode material.

In addition to the 2D materials enumerated above, layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) also emerged because of their unique crystalline structure and excellent physicochemical properties, such as high redox reactivity, rapid ion diffusion, large speci /uniFB01 c surface area, and controllable interlayer space. 19,25 -27 The sandwich structure of X-M-X (X represents the chalcogenide atom and M represents the transition metal atom), superimposed together by van der Waals (vdW) forces, is conducive to the migration of electrons and Li + ions. 28,29 Interestingly, different coordination modes of transition metal atoms will result in different polymorphs, and endow layered TMDs with different properties. Monolayer 2D TMDs mainly consist of two basic phases: trigonal prismatic phase (1 H) and octahedral phase (1 T), which have hexagonal (D3h) and tetragonal (D3d) symmetry, respectively. 30 Among them, group IVB (e.g., Ti, Zr, Hf) TMDs present octahedral structures, which are the most thermodynamically stable phase, then all exhibit the same electronic characteristics according to their band structures. 31 Amongst the wide variety of TMDs, it is well known that titanium sul /uniFB01 de (TiS2) is a /uniFB01 rst-generation intercalating cathode material for lithium batteries, 32 and it also shows good performance in Li-S batteries, improving the cycle life and high rate performance. 33 -38 There are several reasons why TiS2 has been widely used in Li-S batteries. Firstly, TiS 2 possesses the lightest weight, lowest cost and high stability of all the 2D layered TMDs. Secondly, TiS2 has high electronic and ionic conductivity, which means it could realize fast electronic/ionic transport in Li-S batteries. Thirdly, TiS2 with the polar Ti-S bond shows a strong sur /uniFB01 cial af /uniFB01 nity with LiPSs, con /uniFB01 nes LiPSs during cycling, and thus the dissolution of LiPSs is greatly suppressed. More importantly, TiS2 has been demonstrated to provide an additional capacity of 239 mAh g -1 by reversible

insertion of lithium ions at 1.7 ∼ 2.5 V, 32 the same operating voltage window of Li-S batteries, which distinguishes TiS2 from other polysul /uniFB01 de compounds. To our knowledge, there is a lack of comprehensive microscopic insight into the anchoring effect of TiS2 for Li-S batteries. Additionally, titanium selenide (TiSe2) and titanium telluride (TiTe2) share the same structure and similar properties with TiS2, but are rarely used in Li-S batteries. And there has been no systematic study of the reasons behind this phenomenon.

Hence, in this work, we selected titanium dichalcogenides, TiX2 (X = S, Se, Te), as the research objects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to systematically probe the anchoring behaviors of all the Li-S related species (Li2S, Li2S2, Li2S4, Li2S6, Li2S8 and S8) over TiX2. The adsorption energy, charge transfer, decomposition energy together with diffusion energy were discussed in detail in order to clarify the anchoring mechanism. Overall, the results offer a basic understanding of polysul /uniFB01 des chemistry on the TiX2 surfaces, and theoretically con /uniFB01 rm the superiority of TiX2 in inhibiting the shuttle effect as previously reported. It would improve the current situation of the empirical selection of anchoring materials by obtaining the change of the adsorption behavior during the whole process of lithiation, and is more conducive to the selection of appropriate anchoring materials, and then promote the performance of Li-S batteries.

## Theoretical Methods

Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). 39 The projector-augmented wave (PAW) 40 potential with a plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV was implemented to describe the electron-ion interactions, this cutoff is suf /uniFB01 cient to reproduce the main properties of the considered materials such as bulk cohesive energy and lattice constants, as proved in Fig. S1 (available online at stacks.iop.org/JES/168/120516/mmedia) (Supporting Information). The electron exchange correlation interactions were calculated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew-BurkeErnzerhof (PBE). 41 The Brillouin-zone integration was sampled with a 4 × 4 × 1 Monkhorst -Pack k-grid mesh for geometry optimization. 42 The vacuum spacing of 25 Å was set to avoid direct interactions caused by periodic boundary conditions. All the lattice parameters and atomic positions were fully optimized until the force tolerance was below 0.01 eV Å -1 . The physical van der Waals interactions were incorporated into the simulations using DFT-D2 method. 43 Besides, Bader charge analysis was applied to study the chemical interaction and charge transfer quantitatively. 44 The calculation of diffusion energy barrier was performed by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method. 45

To evaluate the binding strength between LiPSs (or S8) and TiX2 substrates, the adsorption energy (Eads) is de /uniFB01 ned as shown in Eq. 1

The more negative value means the stronger binding interaction between substrates and LiPSs molecules. 46

However, in the case of the Li-S battery, the electrolyte can very easily interact and stabilize the polysul /uniFB01 de molecules. 47 Calculations in vacuum may underestimate the stability of the polysul /uniFB01 de and would make these adsorption calculations quite different. The effect of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME)/1,3-dioxolane (DOL) solvent on the interaction between monolayer and LiPSs has been con /uniFB01 rmed. 48

## Results and Discussion

Structural properties of TiX2 and LiPSs. -Primarily, Fig. 1a depicts the optimized geometric structures of 2D TiX2, all the bulk TiX2 crystallizes into 1 T structure (CdI2-type) with the space group of P-3m1. 28 The corresponding lattice constant, the bond length along with the bond angle are all listed in Table I. The calculated values of lattice parameters a, b, c with the angles α = β = 90°, γ = 120° are well consistent with the experimental and theoretical results in previous reports. 51 -53 Take TiS2 for an example, it is composed of TiS6 octahedrons, sharing edges by concatenating S atoms, and Ti atoms lie at the center of the octahedral coordination unit, as presented in Fig. 1b. Figure 1c displays that the TiS2 monolayer consists of three atomic sublayers stacked with S -Ti -S sequences in a single unit cell. The Ti plane is tightly sandwiched between two S sublayers with the bond length of 2.43 Å. Although TiSe2 and TiTe2 monolayer own similar crystal structures to TiS2, the lattice parameters gradually increase. Because the atomic size of Te atom is greater than that of Se atom and S atom, the bond lengths of Ti-X and X-X in TiTe2 are also slightly larger than those of the others. 54

In Li-S batteries, sulfur, the main active material of the cathode, undergoes a lithiation reaction during the discharge process, forming a series of S-containing intermediates. Long-chain LiPSs are prone to dissolving in commonly used organic electrolytes, causing fast capacity decay and unstable cycling. As a consequence, it is signi /uniFB01 cant to calculate the adsorption energy of LiPSs with the possible anchoring materials. Here, the geometric structures of Srelated species are depicted in Fig. 2a. S8 has an annular and symmetric structure, 55 with the S -S bond length of 2.09 Å, and the S -S -S bond angle of 108.6°. All the Li2Sn (n = 1, 2, 4, 6, 8) species possess three-dimensional geometric con /uniFB01 gurations, instead of chains of Li atom at each end. 56,57 According to our calculations, the lengths of Li-S bond in Li2S, Li2S2, Li2S4, Li2S6, and Li2S8 are 2.09 Å, 2.24 Å, 2.36 Å, 2.42 Å, and 2.41 Å, respectively. As presented in Fig. 2b, the bond lengths of Li-S augment with the growing amount of S atoms in LiPSs, whereas the S -S bonds do the opposite, which accords with previous studies. 58,59 The calculation results in Fig. S2 shows that, compared with the /uniFB01 nal discharge products Li2S and Li2S2, the high sulfur content LiPSs clusters are more liable to ionize into Li + and Sn 2 -in electrolytes. It is also in good agreement with the previous studies. 60,61

Adsorption of Li 2 S n species on TiX 2 monolayer surface. -After determining the structures and properties of Li2Sn species and 2D TiX2 monolayer, we further explored the interaction between them. To acquire the most favorable adsorption con /uniFB01 gurations, for each LiS related species anchored on the TiX2 monolayer, we examined many con /uniFB01 gurations with separate initial directions and positions, some of them are shown in Figs. S3 -S5. After full relaxation for geometric optimization, the structures with the minimum adsorption energy are selected and will be further discussed in detail. Among them, the optimized adsorption conformations of various S-containing species over the TiS2 monolayer are displayed in Fig. 3. The adsorption con /uniFB01 gurations are similar to previous studies. 62,63 It is seen that all the structures of the adsorbed S8 molecule and Li2Sn species are well preserved. The binding energy to lithium polysul /uniFB01 de generally decreases as its size increases. The Eads reaches a maximum absolute value for the fully lithiated product Li2S, which is 2.50 eV, while Li2S8 has the lowest binding energy, 0.82 eV. For the adsorption of Li2S and Li2S2, both Li atoms are situated on top of the S atoms with the distances between the Li in Li2S and the S on the substrate surface are about 2.42 Å and 2.53 Å, respectively. The Li-S bond length increases to 2.28 and 2.50 Å. The high-sulfurcontent species Li2S8 and Li2S6, tend to be parallel to the substrate and are connected by one Li atom, exhibiting the Eads values of -0.82 and -0.97 eV. The lengths of the shortest Li-S bond between Li2S8, Li2S6 and TiS2 are 2.46 and 2.47 Å, respectively, which are

signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter than the adsorption distance between S8 and TiS2 (3.65 Å). It is notable that the adsorption energy of S8 molecular species on TiS2 monolayer is only -0.64 eV, which is far below that of LiPSs, showing the indicative of an intermolecular interaction between S8 and TiS2. 64

When TiSe2 and TiTe2 are used as substrates, the adsorption con /uniFB01 gurations resemble to TiS2 (see Figs. S7 -S8). However, it is noted that distinct TiX2 systems exhibit relatively different adsorption capacities for LiPSs species, as shown in Fig. 4a. The smaller Eads values and shorter bond lengths indicate a stronger interaction between LiPSs and the substrate. Based on our calculation, the absolute Eads values of Li2S, Li2S2, Li2S4, Li2S6, Li2S8, and S8 on TiSe2 are larger than those on TiTe2 by 0.28, 0.38, 0.37, 0.08, 0.08 and 0.2 eV respectively, pointing that TiSe2 exhibits a better anchoring effect towards polysul /uniFB01 des than TiTe2. Similarly, TiS2 also shows great superiority in anchoring LiPSs compared with TiSe2.

Additionally, the length changes of S -S bond and Li-S bond in LiPSs before and after adsorption were calculated and plotted as demonstrated in Fig. 4b. It is found that LiPSs are deformed slightly after adsorption, which all the S -S bonds are shortened, while the Li-S bonds are elongated. Furthermore, the variations of Li-S bond length ( Δ dLi-S ) in LiPSs over TiS2 are greater than those of TiSe2 and TiTe2. It is helped to draw the conclusion that TiS2 is more capable of adsorbing polysul /uniFB01 de among the three substrates. 65

As described above, high order LiPSs are soluble in electrolyte solutions, resulting in a degeneration of battery performance. Consequently, ideal anchoring materials with stronger adsorption capacity than solvent molecules are needed to restrain the dissolution of long-chain polysul /uniFB01 des. There are two representative solvent molecules, namely DME and DOL, whose structures are displayed in Fig. S9. The interaction between the Li2Sn (n = 4, 6, 8) species and DME/DOL was computed and it is concluded the binding strengths of high-order LiPSs adsorbed on DOL and DME (0.70 ∼ 0.82 eV) are smaller than those on TiS2 substrates considered in this work (see Fig. S10 and Table SI). In general, TiS2 monolayer works as a favorable anchoring material for Li-S batteries. Owing to its strong adsorption ability towards LiPSs and S8, it can effectively anchor soluble Li2Sn clusters and inhibit their solvation in the electrolytes, thus mitigating the ' shuttle effect. ' This is in accordance with the polysul /uniFB01 de adsorption experiment, which found that the color of LiPSs solution became lighter after the interaction with TiS2. 36,38,66

When the solvent effect is taken into account, the overall adsorption energies show the same trend but decrease signi /uniFB01 cantly, as shown in Fig. 5a. Under the competition of DME/DOL solvent, the interaction between TiX2 monolayer and LiPSs is reduced. The DFT-D2 method was used to incorporate the contributions of physical vdW and chemical interactions in the adsorption process. As described in Fig. S6, the changes of the adsorption energies show the same trend. The calculated adsorption energies without vdW interactions can only be regarded as the chemical interactions. TiS2 exhibits the superior chemical adsorption than TiSe2 and TiTe2, due to the stronger binding strength with LiPSs. Furthermore, Bader charge analysis was adopted to make a quantitative charge transfer. In Fig. 5b, we plotted the amount of charge transfer of LiPSs on the

Figure 7. (a) Energy barrier of Li2S migration over different TiX2 substrates. (b) Diffusion process of Li2S on TiS2 monolayer.

three substrates. It is observed that the largest amount of charge is delivered from Li2Sn to TiS2 monolayer, resulting in strong chemical interaction and improved anchoring effect. And, there is little charge transfer between substrate materials and S8, especially TiTe2, it may be attributed to the dominance of physical vdW interaction in this adsorption process.

Stability and diffusion of LiPSs on TiX 2 . -It is also important to evaluate whether the adsorbed Li2Sn species are stable on the surface of anchoring materials. As a result, we calculated the energy differences between the integrated and dissociated structures of Li2Sn (n = 4, 6, 8). There are two decomposed forms, Li* + LiSn* and Li* + Li* + Sn*, for example, the decomposition of Li2S4 is shown in Fig. 6a. The listed energies Δ E1 and Δ E2 in Fig. 6b and Tables SII -SIII, are employed to assess the stability of integral Li2Sn clusters. Here, Δ E1 = E (Li* + LiSn* + TiX2) -E (Li2Sn* + TiX2), and Δ E2 = E (Li* + Li* + Sn* + TiX2) -E (Li2Sn* + TiX2), respectively. The positive value indicates that the intact structure is energetically preferable to the dissociated one; in other words, the decomposed con /uniFB01 gurations are more unstable. 62,67 Here, the calculated energies of Δ E1 and Δ E2 are all positive for the three anchoring materials, suggesting that the destruction of Li2Sn is unfavorable. Through the comparison among these three LiPSs cases, it is found that the decomposition of high-order Li2S6 and Li2S8 is more likely to occur. This is because during this lithiation stage, the chemical interaction between Li2Sn (n = 6, 8) and AM are weaker. 62 It is worth mentioning that there is a larger energy difference and hence the intact Li2Sn cluster con /uniFB01 guration can be better retained on TiTe2. It is well consistent with the above discussion on the variations of Li -S and S -S bonds in LiPSs (see Fig. 4b). But considering the above discussion, TiS2 can strike a balance between binding strengths and integrity of LiPSs.

The diffusion behavior of Li2S on TiX2 substrates re /uniFB02 ects the performance of batteries partly. Therefore, we studied and obtained the diffusion barrier value and diffusion path, as shown in Fig. 7, Figs. S11 and S12. It can be seen that the diffusion barriers are very low on the whole and conform to the rule of positive correlation with adsorption energies. 68 Although TiTe2 shows better diffusion behavior compared with TiS2 and TiSe2, TiTe2 has the worst adsorption capacity for LiPSs, and it is not quali /uniFB01 ed to suppress the shuttle effect. TiS2, with the acceptable diffusion energy barrier, can effectively adsorb LiPSs, so it can serve as ideal anchoring material in Li-S batteries.

## Conclusions

In this study, the potentials and properties of 2D TiX2 (X = S, Se, Te) monolayer as anchoring materials have been investigated through DFT calculations. Firstly, the optimized geometric structures of TiX2 and Li-S related species were determined, to compare with the con /uniFB01 gurations after adsorption. And then the con /uniFB01 gurations of LiPSs anchored on the surface of TiX2 were acquired via computing the adsorption energy and distance. By comparing the adsorption energy, and charge transfer on different substrates as well as the variations of the bond length in LiPSs before and after adsorption, we concluded that TiS2 showed the best adsorption effect. Besides, the stability of LiPSs and diffusion behavior of Li2S on TiX2 monolayer were studied. The positive dissociation adsorption energy of Li2Sn over TiX2 substrates indicates that LiPSs can stably exist on TiX2. The low energy barriers of Li2S diffusion on the TiX2 surface could accelerate the electrochemical process. Interestingly, compared with TiSe2 and TiTe2, the decomposition and diffusion of lithium polysul /uniFB01 de on TiS2 are not the best. But generally, the strong adsorption capacity, good stability of LiPSs, and acceptable diffusion energy barrier con /uniFB01 rm TiS2 a highly competitive anchoring material for Li -S batteries.
