Solid-state Li-S batteries (SSLSBs) are made of low-cost and abundant materials free of supply chain concerns. Owing to their high theoretical energy densities, they are highly desirable for electric vehicles 1-3 . However, the development of SSLSBs has been historically plagued by the insulating nature of sulfur 4,5 and the poor interfacial contacts induced by its large volume change during cycling 6,7 , impeding charge transfer among different solid components. Here we report an S 9.3 I molecular crystal with I 2 inserted in the crystalline sulfur structure, which shows a semiconductor-level electrical conductivity (approximately 5.9 × 10 -7 S cm -1 ) at 25 °C; an 11-order-ofmagnitude increase over sulfur itself. Iodine introduces new states into the band gap of sulfur and promotes the formation of reactive polysulfides during electrochemical cycling. Further, the material features a low melting point of around 65 °C, which enables repairing of damaged interfaces due to cycling by periodical remelting of the cathode material. As a result, an Li-S 9.3 I battery demonstrates 400 stable cycles with a specific capacity retention of 87%. The design of this conductive, low-melting-point sulfur iodide material represents a substantial advancement in the chemistry of sulfur materials, and opens the door to the practical realization of SSLSBs.

Solid-state Li-S batteries (SSLSBs) with inorganic solid electrolytes do not suffer from the capacity fade associated with the 'polysulfide shuttle' phenomenon in liquid electrolytes 8,9 .  They involve direct conversion between S and Li 2 S during cycling 4,10 , and rely entirely on the interfaces between the solid electrolytes, conductive carbon and S species to transfer charge 11,12 . This reliance paired with the insulating nature of S (electrical conductivity of approximately 5 × 10 -18 S cm -1 ) is untenable. Further, S expands by around 79% when converted to Li 2 S, leading to failures of solid/solid interfaces (Extended Data Fig. 1a) 13,14 . By contrast, a liquid/solid interface always maintains perfect contact. In this regard, a sulfur material with intrinsic conductivity and a low melting point will allow for the initial formation and subsequent re-formation of perfect interfaces (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

distribution of S and I. S 9.3 I seems to be a unique composition on the basis of DSC analysis, where residual S or I 2 is observed except for the 9.3:1 ratio. These results are also consistent with the Raman spectra (Extended Data Fig. 1f).

S9.3 I is readily synthesized by grinding stoichiometric amounts of S and I 2 powder in air and heating the mixture to 80 °C in a sealed container (Extended Data Fig. 1c). The melting point of S 9.3 I is approximately 65 °C as confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC; Extended Data Fig. 1d) and in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD; Extended Data Fig. 1e). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping (Extended Data Fig. 1g-i) indicates that the as-prepared S 9.3 I solid has a homogeneous

The XRD pattern of S 9.3 I (Fig. 1a) seems to be very similar to that of S in the wide-angle region, but has a prominent broad peak centred at approximately 1.5°. This peak corresponds to a d-spacing of 5.8 nm, indicative of the formation of a superstructure. More information on the XRD analysis can be found in Extended Data Fig. 1j. Atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis (Fig. 1b) shows an absence of I 2 with long range ordering, but I-I remains after melting. In S PDF, the peaks at around 2.0 Å, 3.3 Å and 4.5 Å correspond to unique correlations within the S 8 puckered ring. Their dominance along with the presence of the 2.7 Å peak in the S 9.3 I PDF indicate the structure is mainly composed of S 8 rings with the insertion of I 2 molecules. The mass spectra of S 9.3 I and S further show that I 2 molecules are inserted into the S structure (Extended Data Fig. 1k). Further PDF analyses of sulfur iodide with different S:I ratios (Extended Data Fig. 1l) are consistent with the DSC, XRD and Raman data. Moreover, solid S 9.3 I has a density of 2.45 g cm -3 , slightly higher than that of sulfur (2.07 g cm -3 ). The material density remains rather constant in its liquid (approximately 2.35 g cm -3 ) and

To elucidate the structure of S 9.3 I, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed by using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) meta-GGA functional. The SCAN functional yields better agreement with experimental cell parameters for S (Extended Data Table 1) and has been extensively benchmarked on the energetics and structure relaxations of diversely bonded materials 15 . The calculations were performed on candidate structures wherein S 8 rings (molecular mass = 256.48 g mol -1 ) within orthorhombic octasulfur are substituted by linear I 2 (253.8 g mol -1 ) or I 3 (380.7 g mol -1 ) molecules, spanning a compositional range from S 60 I (one I 2 substituting for a single S 8 unit in the octasulfur unit cell) to S 8 I (six I 2 replacing four S 8 units). We find that the lowest energy configuration of the S 9.6 I composition (five I 2 replacing four S 8 units) is close to the experimental S 9.3I composition, and has a small energy above hull of 13 meV per atom (Fig. 1c). It is well within the typical energy range of thermal contributions at room temperature (around 25 meV per atom) and typical thresholds of energies above hull used to ascertain potential synthesizability of materials (around 50 meV per atom) 16 . The relaxed S 9.6 I configuration has a negligible 3% volume shrinkage and a higher computed density of 2.21 g cm -3 compared with bulk S, which is consistent with the experimental observations. The computed XRD patterns also feature a peak at low angles, indicative of a superstructure (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The computed PDF of S9.6 I structure matches well with the experimental data with major peaks present at 2, 2.7 and 3.4 Å (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We also note that the SCAN lattice energy of S 9.6 I (-361 meV per molecule) is approximately 40 meV per molecule smaller than that of S (-400 meV per molecule). This indicates that I 2 incorporation disrupts the van der Waals interactions in S 8 , which contributes to the lowered melting point. The structures in the S 9.6 I-S 8 I compositional space are also analysed to understand the broader impact/trend of I 2

substitution (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Unless specified, the results of S9.6 I composition hold for all these compositions.

Using Bader charge analysis, we quantified the charge transfer between S and I in S 9.6 I by calculating the net difference between the charge on an I atom in S 9.6 I and the number of valence electrons in atomic I. A small charge transfer of 0.067 electrons is found, indicating limited charge transfer. This is corroborated by the experimental S K-edge and I L 2 -edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS; Fig. 1d). Changes in electronic structure of S upon formation of S 9.3 I are further probed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). In situ EPR spectra during heating from 20 °C to 150 °C (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b) show the radical concentration in S 9.3 I grows with increasing temperature; by contrast, no EPR signal is obtained from pure S. The high level of radicals in S 9.3 I (Extended Data Fig. 3c) motivates us to measure its electrical conductivity, which is found to be 5.9 × 10 -7 S cm -1 at 25 °C (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 3d-f), an 11-orders-of-magnitude increase over elemental S. This observation can be rationalized by visualizing the computed partial density of states of S and S 9.6 I. Pure S has a HeydScuseria-Ernzehof (HSE) functional band gap of 2.92 eV (Extended Data Fig. 2d), slightly higher than experimental values of 2.4-2.7 eV reported previously 17,18 . The introduction of I 2 adds states within the gap and reduces the HSE band gap to 1.65 eV (Fig. 1f). A qualitatively similar result is obtained for the SCAN functional (Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). There is only a small overlap between the S and I states, consistent with the fact that little charge transfer is observed between S 8 and I 2 . We find that there is a monotonic decrease in the band gap with increasing I concentration (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We note that iodine itself has semiconducting properties due to electronic interactions between neighbouring I 2 molecules, and we believe that such interactions also occur in sulfur iodides. This decrease in the band gap upon introducing I 2 species into the system explains the increase in conductivity from elemental S to S 9.6 I. Additionally, the absence of partially filled bands

and the limited charge transfer between S 8 and I 2 molecules indicate that sulfur iodide is a thermodynamically metastable material rather than a dynamically stabilized one 19 .

S9.3 I is evaluated in a solid-state battery with Li 3 PS4 (LPS) as the electrolyte. The cathode composite is melted at 100 °C to achieve excellent interfacial contact (Extended Data Fig. 4). LPS is chosen as it is found to contribute limited capacity (Extended Data Fig. 5a-d). Super P carbon (SP) is applied as an interlayer between Li and solid electrolyte to stop the growth of Li dendrites (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f), which is inspired by the Ag/C interlayer design reported previously 20 . We note that there are other promising approaches to address the Li anode stability issue 21 . More details are provided in the Methods.

The Li-S9.3 I cell (Fig. 2a) is cycled at a current density of 0.16 A g -1 and at different temperatures. Specific capacities ranging from 811.8 to 1,211.3 mAh g -1 are delivered from 25 °C to 100 °C. Increasing the operating temperature greatly enhances cell kinetics as demonstrated by smaller polarization and higher capacities. The stability of the cells operating above the melting point of S 9.3 I is enabled by its high viscosity coupled with our cell design (Methods). By contrast, the elemental S cathode (Fig. 2b) delivers much lower capacities, probably owing to its poor electronic conductivity. The differential capacity analysis profiles (d Q /d V ) of the S cathode show one redox reaction plateau (Extended Data Fig. 6a,b), whereas S 9.3 I shows two, implying their distinct working mechanisms. The two plateaus for S 9.3 I are most likely related to the polysulfide intermediates that are absent in the S cathode reactions. S 9.3 I exhibits the most stable and highest capacity compared with materials with other S:I ratios (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). Moreover, a capacity of 489.4 mAh g -1 is delivered even at a rate of 5.60 A g -1 , comparing favourably with other reported SSLSBs (Extended Data Fig. 6e-g and Extended Data Table 2) 9,13,14,22-28 . At a loading of 4.2 mg cm -2 of S 9.3 I,

the cathode still delivers a specific capacity of 968.5 mAh g -1 after 50 cycles at 0.32 A g -1 (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). The anode interface is still well maintained and Li is deposited underneath the SP interlayer (Extended Data Fig. 7).

Long-term cycling performance at room temperature is critical towards the practical application of SSLSBs. When cycled at a current density of 0.16 A g -1 (Fig. 2c), the capacity of the S 9.3 I cathode increases slightly owing to progressive activation during the initial 10 cycles, but decays to 794.6 mAh g -1 by the 50th cycle. This fade is attributed to degradation of the cathode interfaces and can be addressed by briefly remelting the cathode at 100 °C before cycling again at 25 °C, in which the full cell capacity recovers to 828.1 mAh g -1 . In this regard, the Li-S 9.3 I full cell can be periodically repaired in situ over its lifetime. By heat treating the cell every 50 cycles, a capacity of 701 mAh g -1 (87% retention) and an average Coulombic efficiency of about 99.8% are maintained after 400 cycles, outperforming other reported SSLSBs (Extended Data Fig. 6j and Extended Data Table 2). The voltage profiles (Fig. 2d) at different cycles indicate minimal polarization increase. Moreover, S9.3 I cathodes at 40 °C, 60 °C and 80 °C also show excellent Coulombic efficiency and cycling stability (Extended Data Fig. 6k-m). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results confirm the enhancement in electrode kinetics for S 9.3 I over S (Extended Data Fig. 8). The remarkable electrical conductivity and melt-driven interface repair provided by the S 9.3 I cathode result in accelerated electrochemical reaction kinetics, solving many of the operational challenges of SSLSBs.

To probe the working mechanism of the S 9.3 I cathode, Fig. 3a shows the S K-edge XAS of the cathode at different states of charge. The S-S π* feature in S 8 (ref. 29) shifts to lower energy levels, corresponding to the formation of short chain LiS x when discharged to 1.7 V (D-1.7 V),

and further shifts to those attributed to Li 2 S and long chain LiS x when discharged to 1.3 V (D-1.3 V). This process is fully reversible, as S 8 features are recovered upon charge to 3.0 V (C-3.0 V). This reversibility is also corroborated with the S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Fig. 3b). In the pristine state, only S 0 (elemental S, 163.9 eV) and Sp (LPS, 162.0 eV) signals can be resolved 30 . On discharge to 1.7 V, the peak intensity of S 0 decreases and the peaks assigned to S b (bridge S in LiS x , 163.5 eV), S t (terminal S in LiS x , 161.7 eV) and S 2(Li 2 S, 160.5 eV) increase 31,32 . When further discharged to 1.3 V, S 0 peak disappears, S b and St peaks decrease, and the S 2peak increases.

good reversibility shown in the XAS data, again returning to the pristine state after charging to 3.0 V (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The excellent reversibility of the S 9.3 I cathode is also demonstrated by ex situ Raman (Extended Data Fig. 9b) and ex situ EPR (Extended Data Fig. 9c-f).

To probe the mechanism further, a chemically lithiated S 9.3 I prepared at an equivalent discharge capacity of approximately 800 mAh g -1 (Methods) is shown to contain large amounts of long chain LiS x along with Li 2 S as indicated by XAS (Fig. 3a) and XPS (Extended Data Fig. 9g) results. By contrast, the elemental S cathode discharged to 1.3 V shows negligible amounts of LiS x and a small amount of Li 2 S. The existence of

LiS x in S 9.3 I cathodes discharged to 1.3 V and the chemically lithiated S 9.3 I is further confirmed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy analysis of their tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution (Extended Data Fig. 9h,i). Overall, the formation of LiS x during cycling is an essential feature of the working mechanism of S9.3 I cathode. Further XRD analysis confirms the presence of Li 2 S in chemically lithiated S 9.3 I (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), EDX and Li electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) indicate a homogeneous distribution of S, I and Li species over the bulk area of the sample (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 10b,c and Methods), implying no phase segregation. The S:I atomic ratio in lithiated S 9.3 I determined by EDX is 9.6:1, very close to the theoretical ratio.

The evolution of the cathode/electrolyte interface during cycling is investigated by cross-sectional SEM. In the as-prepared cell (Fig. 4a), the S 9.3 I cathode is around 19 μm thick and shows intimate interfacial contact with the LPS layer. After 50 cycles at 25 °C, interfacial voids are observed (Fig. 4b), presumably owing to the volume change of the cathode during cycling. The thickness of the cathode layer also increases to about 22 μm, pointing to further porosity buildup inside the cathode composite. The electrode undergoes melt-driven in situ interfacial repair after being heated to 100 °C followed by cooling back to 25 °C (Fig. 4c). The S:I ratio inside the cathode after repeated heatingcooling processes shows negligible change (Extended Data Fig. 10d,e). Interfacial repair by heating also manifests itself in EIS (Extended data Fig. 10f,g) and distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analyses (Fig. 4d). Relaxation times in the range of 0.1-1 s are associated with the impedance of ion transport across the cathode interface 33,34 . The interfacial impedance continuously increases from the first cycle to the 50th cycle, but is reduced by reheating to the value after the first cycle. A similar restoration is observed at the 100th cycle as well. Reheating is thus highly effective in healing the cathode interface as demonstrated in the cycling stability shown in Fig. 2c. Melt-driven in situ repair of the interface is enabled by the low melting point of S 9.3 I, which is supported by DSC data (Fig. 4e).

Overall, the design of this conducting sulfur iodide molecular crystal material with a low melting point expands the scope of solid-state chemistry of sulfur. Iodine contributes new states inside the band gap of sulfur to introduce electronic conductivity and promotes the formation of LiS x species, which are essential in increasing the reactivity of sulfur cathode. The discovery of the sulfur iodide material might inspire searches for other sulfur materials that have even lower melting points and higher conductivities.

The following materials were used: sulfur powder (Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.98%), iodine powder (Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.99%), vapour grown carbon fibre (VGCF; Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.99%, length: approximately 2-10 μm, diameter: about 200 nm), LPS (NEI, ion conductivity (25 °C): approximately 1 × 10 -4 S cm -1 , size: about 3-5 μm), Li 6 PS5Cl (LPSCl; NEI, ion conductivity (25 °C): 9.3 × 10 -4 S cm -1 , size: about 3-5 μm), SP (MTI, about 40 nm), Li foils (China Energy Lithium, &gt;99.95%, about 250 μm and about 50 μm), Li powder (China Energy Lithium, &gt;97%, 25-60 μm), THF (anhydrous, Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.99%) and Li 2 S powder (Sigma-Aldrich, &gt;99.98%).

## Preparation of sulfur iodide materials

Sulfur iodide materials with different sulfur to iodine ratios were prepared by a two-step procedure. Typically, 1.0 g of S/I mixtures with different ratios were first prepared by grinding stoichiometric amounts of sulfur powder and iodine powder using a mortar and pestle in the air for 10 min. The sulfur iodide materials were then obtained by melting the preprepared S/I mixtures in a small vial (20 ml) at 80 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min -1 followed by a natural cooling procedure. The density of liquid S 9.3 I at 80 °C and 100 °C was measured to be approximately 2.35 and approximately 2.32 g cm -3 , respectively. The bulk modulus of S 9.3 I measured by compression test was 0.29 GPa at 25 °C, which is much smaller than 7.7 GPa of α-S (ref. 35). The viscosity of liquid S 9.3 I increases from approximately 81 to approximately 196 mPa·s when the temperature increases from 80 °C to 100 °C. This behaviour is associated with the increase of the mass fraction of polymeric S chains which can cause more entanglement 36 .

## Preparation of S9.3I-LPS-VGCF cathode composite

The as-synthesized sulfur iodide pellets were crushed into powders using mortar and pestle. A mixture composed of S 9.3 I powder, LPS and VGCF with a weight ratio of 4:4:2 was loaded into a 100 ml ball-milling jar inside a glovebox (O 2 and moisture below 0.5 ppm) and milled at 500 rpm for 10 h. The weight ratio of ball-milling beads to the cathode composite was around 40:1. The S-LPS-VGCF cathode composite was prepared with the same procedure as the S 9.3I-LPS-VGCF cathode.

## Cell fabrication

Li/SP/LPSCl/SP/Li symmetric cells. First, 200 mg of LPSCl powder was loaded into a poly(ether-ether-ketone) (PEEK) die with a diameter of 13 mm and two titanium electrodes block on both sides. A pressure of approximately 30 MPa was applied to press the loose LPSCl powder into the die. After that, about 4-5 mg cm -2 of SP powder was loaded on both sides of the LPSCl pellet and a high pressure of 360 MPa was applied for densification. Finally, two pieces of Li foils (around 250 μm) were assembled into the symmetric cells with a pressure of approximately 30 MPa.

Li/SP/LPSCl/LPS/cathode full cells. First, 180 mg of LPS powder was loaded into a PEEK die with two titanium electrodes and pressed with a pressure of 30 MPa. Subsequently, 60 mg of LPSCl powder was pressed on one side of the prepressed LPS pellet at 30 MPa. Then, 4-5 mg cm -2 of SP powder and about 3 mg cm -2 of cathode powder were pressed on the LPSCl and LPS sides, respectively, at 30 MPa. A high pressure of 360 MPa was then used to press the SP/LPSCl/LPS/cathode composite together for 5-10 min. A piece of Li foil (around 50 μm) was then attached to the SP surface to complete the assembly of the solid-state full cells. A pressure of 30 MPa was maintained during cycling tests and periodical interface repair by heating. The full cells with high mass loading cathodes were assembled using the same procedure except with a mass loading of 10.5 mg cm -2 of the cathode composite. It should be noted that the viscosity of liquid S 9.3 I at 80 °C and 100 °C is approximately

81 and approximately 196 mPa·s, respectively, which greatly limits its flowability in a composite cathode. To further prevent any leakage at elevated temperatures during cycling, we designed a Swagelok cell in which the size difference between the titanium piston and the PEEK die cylinder was ≤0.1 mm. To prevent the liquid cathode from flowing into the LPS solid state electrolyte layer, we placed the cathode at the bottom and the anode on top for battery tests when running above the melting point of the cathode. Moreover, LPS becomes much denser than LPSCl after heating at 100 °C. As a result, the Li-S 9.3 I full cells were heat treated at this temperature before further testing. A dense LPS layer can help prevent any diffusion of the liquefied S 9.3 I cathode, although its high viscosity makes such diffusion unlikely.

## Electrochemical characterization

Before the electrochemical performance tests, all of the symmetric cells and full cells were heated at 100 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min -1 followed by natural cooling procedures in the oven. After that, cells underwent galvanostatic cycling at different temperatures on a LAND battery test system after resting for 3 h. To measure the long-term cycling stability of the SP interlayer for protecting the lithium metal anode, an Li/Li symmetric cell was cycled at constant current density of 0.3 mA cm -2 and a capacity of 0.3 mAh cm -2 . The EIS tests were performed on a BioLogic VMP300t electrochemical workstation within a frequency range from 7 MHz to 0.01 Hz, and the corresponding DRT analysis was performed using techniques as previously reported 37 .

## XRD

Small-angle and wide-angle X-ray diffraction of different sulfur iodide materials were performed on a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer with a Cu anode (K-alpha emission (Kα), wavelength λ = 1.5418 Å). The primary beam power was set to be 1.76 kW. The sample stage was aligned normal to the sample surface. In situ XRD analysis (30-150 °C) of S 9.3 I powder during heating was performed on a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer, which was equipped with a rotating Cu anode (Kα λ = 1.5418 Å) and a Vantec 500 area detector. The XRD patterns were collected every 5 °C. Samples are sealed in a borosilicate capillary (0.8 mm diameter, approximately 0.01 mm thin-wall, Charles Supper) by using epoxy in an Ar-filled glovebox before being taken out for tests. The sample capillary with the Ti sample holder slit and an internal cartridge heater was placed on a custom-built programmable XYZ stage. For XRD measurements, 50 kV and 24 mA were applied. The XRD data were first processed with the Bruker-AXS GADDS software and further analysed by MDI JADE XRD software.

## Electrical conductivity tests

To measure the electrical conductivity of sulfur iodide materials with different ratios, 180 mg of sample was pressed in a peek die (diameter: 13 mm) with two titanium electrodes at 360 MPa. A constant voltage of 0.2 V, 0.4 V or 0.6 V was applied for 1 h, respectively, to measure the stabilized current on a BioLogic VMP300t electrochemical workstation. The thickness of the sample was confirmed by SEM. On the basis of the voltage, current and the thickness of samples, the electrical conductivity can be calculated.

## SEM

SEM (FEI Quanta 250 SEM) with EDX was used to determine the morphology and chemical composition of the S 9.3 I sample under 30 kV and 0.1 nA. The cross-sectional images of S 9.3 I/LPS and S/LPS mixtures were collected using cryo-focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FEI Scios, Scios DualBeam) at 5 kV and 0.1 nA. The cross-sections were first cut with an ion beam of 30 nA, followed by a surface cleaning process at 0.1 nA. For the cross-sectional SEM analysis of cathode and anode interfaces in the full cells, the samples were prepared by an Argon-ion beam cross-section polisher (IB-19520CCP) developed by JEOL. An accelerating voltage of 4 kV and a milling rate of around 25 μm h -1 were used to minimize artifacts. During milling, the sample stage was placed perpendicular to the ion beam and swung automatically within ±30° to broaden the polished area and avoid beam strains. An air-free vessel was used to transfer samples between the glovebox and characterization tools. The cross-sectional SEM images of cathode and anode interfaces were conducted in Axia ChemiSEM.

## Cryo-TEM

To prepare samples for the tests, a sample suspension in hexane was drop cast on a gold transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid in a glovebox to prevent air and water exposure. The TEM grid was then loaded on a Gatan cryo-holder in a liquid N 2 environment. The holder tip shutter was closed after loading the TEM grid on the holder and during the transfer to the microscope. The sample was kept at liquid N2 temperature in the TEM (FEI Talos F200x microscope) to reduce radiation damage, and characterized using scanning electron microscopy transmission, EDX (FEI Super-X EDX system) and EELS (Gatan Enfinium). The presence of Li in the sample was confirmed by EELS, which showed a peak at approximately 60 eV, an indication of energy loss at the Li K-edge. The presence of S and I elements in the sample was confirmed by EDX. The composite map of S, I was acquired using EDX spectra, and the map of Li was done by EELS spectra. It should be noted that the chemically lithiated S 9.3 I sample was still very sensitive to the electron beam even in the cryo-TEM. To reduce the beam damage, a low electron dose was applied for EDX and EELS during tests. In addition, a suitable particle size should be selected to balance the needs of reducing the radiation damage and of a thinner sample for EELS signal acquisition.

## X-band EPR

X-band EPR measurements were conducted on a Bruker EMXplus EPR spectrometer. All samples were packed into Q-band tubes inside an Ar-filled glovebox and sealed with epoxy. The Q-band tubes were inserted into 4 mm quartz EPR tubes to hold the samples in place inside the resonator cavity. Variable temperature measurements were performed using an X-band Dual Mode EPR resonator (Bruker ER 4119DM). The sample was allowed to equilibrate at the desired temperatures for 10 min before each measurement. Ex situ measurements performed on the S 9.3 I cathode samples at room temperature used a high sensitivity EPR resonator (Bruker ER 4119HS-LC). All measurements were carried out with 2 mW of power, a 100 kHz modulation frequency and a modulation amplitude of 4 Gauss. Spectral fits were conducted with EasySpin 38 .

## XPS

The cathode layers were separated from the solid state electrolyte layer by cracking the pellet cells and the conductive tapes were used to fix cathode samples on the XPS sample holders. The XPS tests were conducted on a Kratos Ultra DLD to study the chemical composition and valence states of the elements in the samples with a spot size ranging 300 μm to 700 μm. All of the samples were transported into XPS equipment through a connected Ar-filled glovebox to avoid any air exposure. XPS spectra were acquired with a 0.1 eV resolution for C1s, S2p and I3d regions. The analysis of XPS spectra was performed using CasaXPS software.

## XAS

The iodine L 2 -edge absorption spectra were measured at fluorescence mode at beamline 7-BM of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Each spectrum takes 15 seconds, and 50 spectra were merged to get the final data for improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The sulfur K-edge spectra were collected in fluorescence mode at the 8-BM beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS II) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). All the XAS results were analysed using the Athena software package 39 .

## PDF

For PDF measurements, the sample powders were packed inside polyimide capillary (Cole-Parmer) tubes sealed by epoxy glue at the end. The PDF data were collected at the 28-ID-2 beamline of the NSLS II at BNL using a photon wavelength of 0.18475 Å. The obtained data were integrated using Fit2D software 40 . The PDF and atomic pair distribution function ( G ( r )) values were extracted using PDFgetX3 software 41 . For the in situ heating PDF experiment, the sample was heated from room temperature (293 K) to 403 K, and cooled back to 293 K with a step size of 5 K.

## UV-Vis spectroscopy

Typically, 20 mg of powder samples was added into 4 ml of THF and then the THF solutions were obtained by centrifugation over several minutes. To prepare the standard Li 2 S4 and Li 2 S6 THF solutions, stoichiometric amounts of Li 2 S and S powder were added into 10 ml of THF with a targeted concentration of 0.2 mmol l -1 . Afterwards, the solution and powder mixtures were vigorously stirred over 5 days until fully dissolved. The measurements of samples were performed on a Hitachi UH4150 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

## DSC

10 mg of a powder sample was sealed in a 40 μl Al pan with a lid inside an Ar-filled glovebox. The samples were measured on a TA Instruments Discovery Series DSC 2500 within the temperature window of 20-150 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min -1 .

## Raman spectroscopy

Raman measurements were performed on a Perkin Elmer RamanStation 400F with a laser wavelength of 785 nm. The air sensitive samples were sealed between two quartz wafers with Kapton film covering the edges.

## Mass spectrometry

Laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDITOFMS) analysis was performed at the Molecular MS Facility at UC San Diego, using a Bruker Autoflex Max matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) instrument. The LDI-TOFMS measurement was operated under negative ion mode. Laser energy was optimized and set at 10% for 'soft' ionization and minimal fragmentation. LDI-TOFMS data were acquired using Bruker flexControl software (v.3.4) and analysed using Bruker flexAnalysis software (v.3.4).

## Computational details

DFT parameters. The DFT calculations were carried out using the projector augmented wave (PAW) approach 42 as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) 43 . Structure relaxation was performed with the SCAN meta-GGA functional. The calculations of the electronic structure (DOS) were performed using the HSE functional 44 as well as the SCAN functional. All the calculations were spin polarized with an energy cutoff of 520 eV. The energy and force convergence criteria were set to 10 -4 eV and 0.05 eV Å -1 , respectively. For the S unit cell and its derived structures, a Γ-centred k -points mesh of 2 × 1 × 1 was used. For DOS calculations a finer k -points mesh of 2 × 2 × 2 was used. The DFT-optimized minimum energy structures were used to perform Bader charge analysis 45 . All the input generation and output analyses were performed using Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) 46 .

S x I candidate structure generation. S x I candidates at different S:I ratios were obtained by replacing S 8 rings with I 2 or I 3 molecules in octasulfur S unit cells (16 S 8 rings). The I 2 or I 3 molecules were placed at the site of S 8 rings in two possible orientations: parallel to the a -b plane along the S 8 molecular plane or perpendicular to the S 8 molecular

plane. Structure enumeration was performed to obtain several distinct site orderings per composition. In addition, the effect of orientational disorder was considered by placing I 2 or I 3 molecules at different combinations of orientations. The dimensions of the supercell size were 10.587 Å × 12.952 Å × 24.567 Å, which is the same as the unit cell parameter.

(a) The initial discharge/charge curves of a Li-S 9.3 I cell, and the corresponding dQ/dV curves (b) derive from (a). (c) The EIS of the Li-S 9.3 I cell at different states of discharge. (d) The EIS of the Li-S 9.3 I cell at different states of charge. The DRT analysis of EIS at different states of discharge (e) related to (c), and states of charge (f) related to (d). (g) The initial discharge/charge curves of

a Li-S cathode, and the corresponding dQ/dV curves (h) derive from (g). (i) The EIS of the Li-S cell at different states of discharge. (j) The EIS of the Li-S cell at different states of charge. The DRT analysis of EIS at different states of discharge (k) related to (i), and states of charge (l) related to (j). The impedance of S 9.3 I cathode is much lower than that of pure S cathode during cycling.

Extended Data Fig. 9 | Characterizations of intermediates during cycling to diagnose the S9.3I cathode working mechanism. (a) The corresponding ratios of S 0 , S b , S t , and S 2in the S 9.3 I cathode in Fig. 3b at different discharge/charge states. (b) Ex situ Raman spectra of S 9.3 I during the discharge/charge processes. The ex situ Raman spectra suggest the good reversibility of S 9.3 I cathode at RT. X-band EPR spectra obtained on (c) the pristine S 9.3 I cathode, and on (d) the SSE and carbon mixture (LPS-VGCF). (e) Ex situ EPR data obtained on cathode samples harvested from cells stopped at various stages of the initial discharge/ charge processes. (f) Parameters obtained from fits of the EPR spectra in (e), including the ratios of the signal intensities from the S 9.3 I cathode material and from the VGCF additive, and the linewidth of the S 9.3 I EPR signal. The ratio of S9.3 I radicals to carbon decreases during initial discharge and grows upon subsequent charge (f). This trend is consistent with the following model,

assuming that polysulfide chains that form in the solid-state exist as dianions and cannot be detected in our EPR measurements, unlike EPR-active polysulfide radicals formed in solution through disproportionation of polysulfide dianions (as in conventional Li-S cells). (g) The S 2p high resolution XPS of comparison samples, including LPS/VGCF mixture, S cathode discharge to 1.3 V (D-1.3 V) and chemically lithiated S 9.3 I prepared by reacting with Li powder with an equivalent capacity of ~800 mAh g -1 . (h) Digital photos of elemental S cathode discharged to 1.3 V, S 9.3 I cathode discharged to 1.3 V, chemically lithiated S 9.3 I immersed in THF solution and standard Li 2 S4 , Li 2 S6 THF solutions. (i) The UV-Vis spectra of corresponding samples in (h). The S 9.3 I cathode discharged to 1.3 V and chemically lithiated S 9.3 I suspensions exhibit the color of LiS x solutions immediately, but elemental S cathode discharged to 1.3 V doesn't show any change.
