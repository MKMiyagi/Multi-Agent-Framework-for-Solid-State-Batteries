Lithium metal solid state batteries (LMSSB) attract great interest in academia and industry due to their projected high energy density and safety. However, hard short circuits due to the penetration of lithium /uniFB01 laments through the solid electrolyte impede their development for practical application. Here, multi-characterization methods ranging from operando and in situ scanning electron microscopy to ex situ focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy are employed for comprehensive understanding of the cell failure. The rapid failure is attributed to coupled crack propagation and subsequent lithium /uniFB01 lament growth during the plating process which is demonstrated in a Li6PS5Cl (lithium argyrodite) based LMSSB. Cracking initiates at current constriction spots and voids, where inhomogeneous lithium plating/stripping causes high local stress /uniFB01 elds that trigger continuous crack propagation. Lithium /uniFB01 lament growth /uniFB01 nally leads to a hard short circuit. Considering the low fracture toughness of ceramic electrolytes, strengthening with Al2O3 /uniFB01 bers is shown to be effective in signi /uniFB01 cantly improving the critical current density and cycling stability. Our results clearly show that cracks can have a detrimental effect on LMSSB and we suggest focusing on strategies to improve the fracture toughness of thiophosphate electrolytes in order to suppress lithium /uniFB01 lament growth.

## Introduction

The invention and continuous improvement of the Li-ion battery have advanced our societies with respect to electri /uniFB01 cation over the last three decades, especially in the /uniFB01 elds of communication and transportation [1 -3]. To match the characteristics of internal combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles with wide range and fast charging capability and improved safety are desired [4]. A transformation from liquid electrolytes to non/uniFB02 ammable solid electrolytes (SE) would not only improve the safety performance of the battery system but largely increase the energy density when coupled with lithium metal [5], which

is regarded as a promising anode because of its high theoretical speci /uniFB01 c capacity (3860 mAh g -1 and lowest potential /C0 3.04 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) [6]. The conversion from graphite to alithium metal anode could signi /uniFB01 cantly increase the energy density up to 50% (gravimetric) and 80% (volumetric) [7,8].

Numerous SEs have been developed through intensive research efforts, including polymers, oxides, sul /uniFB01 des, halides and polymer hybrid composites [9,10]. Among them, sul /uniFB01 des [11] and garnet [12] based SEs reach Li ion conductivities comparable to non-aqueous liquid electrolytes. Unfortunately, when used with a lithium metal anode, most of them can solely enable low current densities due to the growth of lithium /uniFB01 laments that cause internal short circuits across the separator. For instance, the critical current density (CCD) is reported as about 0.2 to

0.5 mA cm -2 and 0.5 to 1 mA cm -2 for the garnet and argyrodite SEs at room temperature, respectively [13,14]. These results indicate even more severe lithium /uniFB01 lament growth and propagation in these two prototype SEs than in non-aqueous liquid electrolytes, which contradicts the expectation of dendrite ( /uniFB01 lament) suppression by SEs with a shear modulus twice larger than that of lithium metal [15]. We like to add that the CCD is not an unequivocal material property but rather depends on various parameters like sample size and geometry, passed charge, etc. . Thus, a comparison of CCDs obtained in different studies is dif/uniFB01 cult. However, within an individual study the CCD can well indicate the effect of dendrite mitigation concepts.

Therefore, intensive efforts were addressed to the study of lithium /uniFB01 laments in LMSSB, and controversies between simulation results and experimental reports raised intense discussions. Simulation models [15] are considered to be too simple without considering grain boundaries [16], surface defects [17], speci /uniFB01 c properties of the Li|SE interface [18], current constriction [19,20], etc .. Early work reported lithium /uniFB01 lament penetration along the grain boundaries in polycrystalline Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), and that grain boundaries could serve as suitable nucleation sites due to a lower nucleation barrier [16]. Han et al. [21] ascribed this issue to a higher electronic conductivity of grain boundary regions and reported islandlike Li growth inside voids or grain boundaries in LLZO after monitoring the lithium concentration pro /uniFB01 les inside three typical SEs (LLZO, LiPON and amorphous Li3PS4) with operando neutron depth pro /uniFB01 ling. Tian et al. [22] revealed that trapped electrons on inner defect surfaces in LLZO may produce isolated lithium nucleation, applying a multiscale model coupling density functional theory calculations and the phase/uniFB01 eld method. These results have recently been supported by Chao et al. [23], who measured increased electron concentrations in grain boundaries of LLZO close to the plating electrode. Kataoka et al. [24] grew centimeter-size Li6.5La3Zr1.5Nb0.5O12 (LLZNb) single crystals and demonstrated short circuit-free operation of a Li|LLZNb|Li symmetric cell only at a low current density of 0.5 mA cm -2 , indicating that grain boundaries in LLZO may not be the only factor for lithium dendrite growth [25]. During lithium stripping, Krauskopf et al. [19] investigated the interfacial evolution and showed that vacancy diffusion limitation in the metal leads to vacancy accumulation and resulting pore formation near the interface, restricting the rate capability of lithium metal anode -yet also causing a highly heterogeneous interface that is prone to current constriction and /uniFB01 lament growth later on. Kasemchainan et al. [26] further differentiated the effect of plating and stripping on the lithium /uniFB01 lament growth, con /uniFB01 rming that voids form when lithium is stripped faster than it can be replenished -as shown originally for Ag|AgI interfaces [27,28]. The voids continue to accumulate during cycling, increase the nonuniform interfacial current density and lead locally to the formation of dendrites during the following plating process. To mitigate the interfacial contact issue, Krauskopf et al. [29] demonstrated alloying lithium metal with 10 at% Mg could effectively prevent contact loss and achieve a rate capability of double-digit l A cm -2 , however, the kinetic limitation due to the chemical diffusion of lithium in the Li-Mg alloy impeded a further increase at room temperature.

In general, different separator failure mechanisms are reported in literature, and diverse strategies were followed to solve the /uniFB01 lament issue in SSBs [30]. To the best of our knowledge, most of these approaches increase the CCD only slightly [31 -33]. Industry standards (such as IEC-6266:2-2010, international, GB/T31467.2-2015, China, and VDA 2007, Germany) for power batteries require a current density of 4 mA cm -2 (calculated from an areal capacity of 4 mAh cm -2 and a rate of 1C for a commercial Li-ion battery) [14]. Thus, the gap between the requirements for practical application and the currently achieved rate performance is still too large [34]. Knowledge on lithium /uniFB01 lament growth remains insuf /uniFB01 cient, and more detailed understanding of the failure mechanism(s) is essential to develop more effective strategies [35]. In this respect, applying operando and in situ characterization methods is a necessary approach to open up mechanistic insight into the origin of lithium /uniFB01 laments [36]. However, investigating the failure mechanism of SSBs through operando/ in situ experiments can be challenging due to the presence of a buried interface and bulk electrolyte. Synchrotron X-ray tomography has proven to be a powerful method to tackle this issue [37], but its scarcity and relatively low lateral resolution hinder its broader use. Therefore, more operando / in situ methods need to be developed. The development of such methods will provide a better understanding of SSBs, paving the way for improved performance and greater reliability in the future.

In this study, we combine different characterization methods to investigate the failure mechanism of LMSSB in the case of the Li6PS5Cl solid electrolyte, which is widely used in SSB development. The results of operando SEM reveal that cracking is the dominating reason for the unsatisfactory low CCD of LMSSB, as suggested by Kasemchainan et al . [26]. Cracks initiate during the plating process and propagate rapidly when lithium /uniFB01 laments grow along the cracks due to the weaker hindrance. The coupled behavior of lithium /uniFB01 lament growth and crack propagation leads to rapid internal short circuit. In situ SEM experiments with microelectrodes and subsequent ex situ FIB SEM examination reveal two further factors that play an important role for the cracking process: void formation and current constriction. During the charge and discharge processes at low stack pressure, voids form at the interface which results in inhomogeneous surface stress and increases the current density locally, and raises the probability of crack initiation and propagation. Our new approach to strengthen the mechanical stability of the SE by incorporation of Al2O3 /uniFB01 bers shows a signi /uniFB01 cantly improved CCD and cycle stability, and demonstrates unequivocally that cracking is the dominant root cause for failure in argyrodite based SSBs. That prompts us to pay more attention on the mechanical properties of ceramic SEs and to search for strategies to enhance their fracture toughness [38]. We like to note that mechanical strengthening of aLi1+xAlxTi2x(PO4)3 SE has already been demonstrated by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) [57], however, the incorporation of an electron-conducting second phase brings the serious risk of bipolar effects and metal deposition within the SE separator [39].

## Results and discussion

(1) Revealing crack propagation during cycling using operando scanning electron microscopy

Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li symmetric cells with an argyrodite pellet of around 1.5 mm thickness were assembled and mounted in the pressure control device as shown in Figure S1B. The ionic conductivity of the Li6PS5Cl pellet was measured to be 2.8 mS cm -1 (Fig. S2). A step-wise increase of current density per cycle caused failure of the cell, enabling us to observe the failure process (Fig. 1b). The area investigated with SEM is indicated by the orange square in the schematic image in Fig. 1a. SEM images of the Li|Li6PS5Cl cross section were collected before and after six full cycles. In addition, the cross section was monitored operando during galvanostatic cycling step (Video S1).

The galvanostatic cycling started always with plating at the lithium metal anode side where the SEM electron beam is focused (orange square in Fig. 1a). To be mentioned, the controlled electron injection during the operando SEM process may lead to lithium metal nucleation and following plating, especially in the case of garnet SE [12]. Before cycling, no cracks were visible in the argyrodite SE as shown in Fig. S3a, indicating an intact pellet without obvious mechanical defects. After six galvanostatic cycles, numerous cracks had formed and are visible in the cross-section of the argyrodite pellet. Two major cracks with several branches originated from the lithium metal anode and formed an interconnected crack network (Fig. S3b). Also, quite wide cracks of up to /uniFB01 ve micrometres width were observed. Clearly, cracking of the ceramic SE separator plays a vital role for battery failure. This is consistent with the cracking failure mechanism of LMSSB reported by Porz et al. [17] and Ning et al. [40]. Recently, Kalnaus et al. [41] investigated the crack formation in lithium phosphorous oxynitride (LiPON) and revealed that the high CCD of LiPON can be attributed to its surprising high ductility (high fracture toughness) and the ability to recover, which highlights that the mechanical properties of SEs should be considered with more care. Fig. 1c-e show three typical states, i.e . at the beginning, after /uniFB01 rst plating step and after the hard internal short circuit had occurred, marked with arrows in Fig. 1b. In the magni /uniFB01 ed SEM images (Fig. 1d), smaller cracks originate from the Li|Li6PS5Cl interface. During the second cycle, the already existing cracks grew, widened and formed new branches, resulting in a crack network throughout the pellet (Fig. 1e).

Lithium /uniFB01 lament penetration through the argyrodite pellet along cracks is captured in Fig. 1f and g. A primary crack of 3 /C24 5 l m width started from the lithium metal electrode and was /uniFB01 lled by a lithium /uniFB01 lament, which is con /uniFB01 rmed by a back scattered electron (BSE) image in Fig. 1g. Several secondary cracks are visible around the primary crack, seemingly formed due to the /uniFB01 lament growth. Obviously, cracking is initiated during the cycling and can be enhanced when lithium /uniFB01 laments grow into the cracks. The coupled behavior of cracking and lithium /uniFB01 lament growth can self-reinforce the propagation, which explains the imperceptible rapid failure of LMSSB with a sudden voltage drop to zero in minutes or even seconds.

To understand the effect of the stripping or plating step on cracking, recorded videos of operando SEM were evaluated. The crack length of the observed cross-section is measured and normalized, shown in Fig. 2, and detail SEM images of the crack evolution during stripping and plating are presented in Fig. S4. As can be seen, cracking started during the /uniFB01 rst plating step (Fig. 2 and S4c-e). During the following stripping step, the existing cracks remained unchanged and even exhibited a slight decrease

Enlarged SEM images of the marked area (orange square in (a)) for three typical states are shown in c, d and e, respectively.

(Figs. 2 and S4f, g). During the second plating step, cracking proceeded again. The cracks increased in width and length, and also new cracks were formed. (Figs. 2 and S4h-k). This sequence of cracking steps during plating and stripping clearly proves the plating induced cracking mechanism.

By measuring and normalizing the crack length during the plating and stripping process, crack initiation and propagation during the plating are identi /uniFB01 ed. High currents result in fast crack propagation. During stripping, the crack maintains and its visible length even slightly decreases (healing).

As the operando experiment only monitors a restricted area, the whole Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li cross-section with a width up to hundreds of micrometers was investigated after galvanostatic cycling. Fig. S5 shows an overview of the entire cross-section where numerous cracks can be identi /uniFB01 ed. Several cracks range from one lithium metal electrode to the opposite lithium metal electrode with a length of several millimeters as shown and marked in the magni /uniFB01 ed SEM images (Fig. S5c-f). These cracks probably serve as the ' expressways ' for the growth of lithium /uniFB01 laments leading to rapid failure, as shown in the schematic in Fig. S5g. Actually, once the lithium /uniFB01 laments grow into the cracks, the local effective conductivity of the ceramic electrolyte ( r eff ) is affected [42].

In equation (1), n is the phase/uniFB01 eld parameter for crack propagation and r SE and r Li are the ionic conductivity of Li6PS5Cl and electronic conductivity of Li metal, respectively. The function ð h n ð Þ ¼ 1 4 n 3 þ 3 4 n þ 1 2 ,) is applied for the interpolation of materials properties for the interface properties of the ceramic electrolyte and lithium metal [42]. In general, when lithium /uniFB01 laments pen- etrate deeper into the ceramic electrolyte, a higher effective local conductivity is the consequence. Thus, cracking propagation and lithium /uniFB01 lament growth will mutually increase and accelerate.

In the previous section, the cracking process was unambiguously identi /uniFB01 ed as the dominant reason for LMSSB failure, in line with the report by Ning et al. [40]. Subsequently, in situ SEM experiments with microelectrodes and ex situ FIB-SEM studies were conducted to /uniFB01 gure out the origin or triggering factors for cracking to acquire more comprehensive understanding.

(2) Analysing the lithium plating behaviour on Li6PS5Cl pellets via in situ SEM experiments with microelectrodes

The lithium plating process occurring at the Li|Li6PS5Cl interface itself takes place at a ' buried ' interface and cannot be detected directly during the operando SEM experiment. As this process plays an important role for the cracking induced failure mechanism, we implemented an in situ SEM experiment with microelectrodes on a 10 mm diameter argyrodite pellet as shown in the schematic image in Fig. S6. Fig. 3 shows results of the plating experiment using a tungsten needle. The needle was placed on a smooth region of the pellet surface (Fig. 3a). As expected and reported before for LLZO SE [12], lithium metal whiskers with vertical growth were observed. However, a decreasing growth rate indicates that the /uniFB01 laments grow preferably into the pellet instead of vertically on the pellet surface (Video S2). Indeed, crack formation, growth and propagation could be observed immediately when current was applied. In accordance to the observation in the operando SEM experiment, a coupled behaviour of cracking and lithium /uniFB01 lament growth was identi/uniFB01 ed, but this time the process was recorded at large magni /uniFB01 cation and the interaction between cracking and /uniFB01 lament growth could be observed directly (Video S2). As shown in Fig. 3a-e, cracking starts at the high current density plating tip. Apparently, forma-

tion of lithium metal appears to be the driving force for the crack formation and growth propagation. A small crack was initiated and lithium metal was plated along the crack subsequently (Fig. 3b and c). With more lithium plating along the crack, several secondary cracks were triggered (Fig. 3d) and the existing cracks started to open up to a few micrometres (Fig. 3e and f). This in situ experiment demonstrated the damage of the current constriction to the solid electrolyte pellets. Poor contact due to insuf /uniFB01 cient stack pressure or contact loss during the continuous plating and stripping are common in realistic SSB cycling, shown in Fig. 3g. In that case, the current constriction area would lead to a high local current (Fig. 3h), which is similar to the demonstrated in situ lithium plating experiment. Such high plating current causes a high plating induced stress (Fig. 3i), which leads to a high probability of SE crack initiation and propagation, especially considering the brittleness of the argyrodite pellets.

Actually, lithium /uniFB01 lament growth (micro- or even nano-sized) shows a highly destructive effect, which cannot be explained by the bulk properties of soft lithium metal with low yield strength.

It has been reported that the mechanical strength of lithium metal is in fact strongly depending on its geometric dimensions [43,44]. A submicrometric lithium /uniFB01 lament growth driven by a suf /uniFB01 cient applied overpotential can generate local growth stress up to tens to hundreds MPa [43], although the yield stress of bulk lithium metal is only around 0.7 MPa [45]. In contrast, the fracture toughness of sul /uniFB01 de solid electrolytes is relatively low [46]. In the case of glassy Li2S-P2S5 SE, the fracture toughness was measured to be (0.23 ± 0.04) MPa m 1/2 via a nanoindentation-based method. This shows the brittle character and indicates that fracture can occur at low stress [47]. Altogether, the lithium plating process can induce high local stress that easily triggers cracking of the brittle SEs, which results in lithium /uniFB01 lament penetration and hard internal short circuits. The in situ SEM experiment indicates that current constriction spots are primary onset points for crack initiation.

(g) Schematic of the poor contact between lithium metal and solid electrolyte due to insufficient stack pressure or contact loss after continuous plating/stripping. (h) Schematic of current constriction area and (i) cracking triggered by the lithium plating induced stress at small surface flaw/defects.

Ex situ FIB-SEM analyses were conducted to gain information on the buried Li|Li6PS5Cl interface after cycling. The cells were assembled in a sandwich structure, Cu|Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li|Cu, to enable disassembling without damaging the cycled sample. The cell was tested at a current density of 0.3 mA cm -2 with an areal capacity of 0.3 mAh cm -2 and an applied pressure of 5 MPa until an internal short circuit occurred. The cell was then disassembled and characterized with FIB-SEM.

Fig. 4 shows SEM images of the cross section of a Li|Li6PS5Cl interface after the internal short circuit had occurred. An overall cross-section view is presented in Fig. 4a, where lithium metal is located on top of the argyrodite pellet. Two different areas can be distinguished and were identi /uniFB01 ed and separated by the white vertical line (Fig. 4a). Fig. 4b and c show the corresponding magni/uniFB01 ed SEM images of the interface contact within the two regions. In the red marked region, a poor interfacial contact with large voids between lithium and Li6PS5Cl (Fig. 4b) and a cracked SE region (Fig. 4e) are shown. Continuous and long cracks are visi- ble in the void formation area. In contrast, in the green marked region intimate interfacial contact (Fig. 4c) and crack-free SE (Fig. 4d) are found, which is comparable to an uncycled sample (Fig. S7). It is known that voids can form at the interface and accumulate during cycling [19,45], if the stripping current density removes lithium faster from the interface than it can be replenished by lithium diffusion or if inhomogeneous stripping occurs. During this void formation process, regions with current constriction occur, raising the possibility of lithium plating induced SE cracking.

Void formation can affect cell performance in two ways: Firstly, the local current density increases gradually, thus generating higher plating stress, which therefore might initiate cracking of the brittle ceramic electrolyte [26]. Secondly, voids can release interfacial stress which results in an inhomogeneous interfacial stress /uniFB01 eld. The heterogeneous regions of both intimate contact and neighbouring voids are spots at which cracks preferentially form (Fig. 4e) due to stress concentration. The ex

situ FIB SEM results are in accordance with the operando and in situ SEM experiments and show that void formation, crack formation and Li /uniFB01 lament growth are coupled phenomena as shown in Fig. 4D.

The low fracture toughness of the Li6PS5Cl ceramic electrolyte is also demonstrated by a time resolved electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) measurement (Fig. S8). With a high stack pressure of 75 MPa, the total resistance of a symmetric Li| Li6PS5Cl|Li cell gradually decreased and after 13 h, a physical internal short circuit occurred (Fig. S8a). After disassembling the cell, several cracks in the ceramic pellet were visible which were /uniFB01 lled with lithium metal (Fig. S8b and S8c). The lithium metal had penetrated starting from surface defects/ /uniFB02 aws ( ' precracks ' ) of the ceramic electrolyte. During /uniFB01 lament growth, the electrochemical plating process then generates high stress ( r p ) as described by the following equation [43],

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where D / is the overpotential at the interface of the lithium metal anode and the ceramic electrolyte, F denotes Faraday ' s constant ( F = 96,488 C mol -1 ) and V m represents the molar volume of lithium metal ( V m ð Li Þ = 13 cm 3 mol -1 ). According to equation (2), an overpotential of 10 mV can cause a plating stress of up to 75 MPa [17]. Such high local stress can easily lead to mechanical cracking of the ceramic pellet. Clearly, fast void formation during stripping, the resulting uneven interfacial stress distribution and surface defects can then accelerate the cracking process during plating.

The results from the combination of several experimental techniques, including operando , in situ SEM and ex situ FIB-SEM reveal that cracking of the ceramic SE is the main reason for cell failure. There are different causes for triggering cracking, yet low fracture toughness of the SE is undoubtedly the most critical ingredient. In summary, three key factors are responsible: 1. Void induced current constriction and highly inhomogeneous current distribution, 2. resulting inhomogeneous stress distribution at the interface and 3. surface defects/ /uniFB02 aws ( ' pre-cracks ' on the surface), which are schematically shown in Fig. 5.

Numerous papers have previously discussed the mechanism of dendrite formation, partly with con /uniFB02 icting conclusions on its main driving force, which can be summarized into three different categories as follows. First, Han et al . as well as Kasemchainan et al . conclude among others that a bad interfacial contact, be it either by bad preparation or stripping induced voiding will lead to fast dendrite growth due to current constriction [26,48]. Other works, however, rather ascribe the dendrite propagation to a high intrinsic local electronic conductivity, e.g. at grain boundaries [21,23,49]. Thirdly, SE cracking, be it either before or during dendrite propagation, is also frequently discussed as the main reason for short-circuiting [17,40,50,51]. We believe that all three effects, depending on the speci /uniFB01 c material combination used, can contribute to the dendrite formation. This work serves as an important puzzle piece in further elucidating the cracking as the main failure mechanism in Li|Li6PS5Cl cells, as we were able to uniquely couple the high resolution in situ and operando SEM with a simultaneous control of the applied stack pressure. Our method demonstrated here can further be utilized to study other material combinations.

Cracking of the Li6PS5Cl electrolyte is demonstrated as the dominating cause for failure of the ceramic separator in LMSSB due to its low fracture toughness. Three key triggers for cracking are shown: (1) current constriction, (2) void induced inhomogeneous interfacial stress and (3) surface defects/ /uniFB02 aws provide starting spots for crack formation.

Furthermore, Li6PS5Cl is thermodynamically unstable in contact with lithium and will react to form a SEI according to equation (3) [52]. The role of the SEI for the formation and growth of dendrites has rarely been addressed, but we assume that it may play a critical role, as SEI formation leads to local pore formation, as demonstrated by Otto et al. [53].

FIG. 5

Summary of the failure mechanism in Li6PS5Cl based LMSSB as analysed in this work.

A volume change analysis based on the reaction equation shows a decrease of approximate 27% after SEI formation. This suggests that the SEI /uniFB01 lm may not be a dense and continuous /uniFB01 lm, but rather a porous structure due to the volume shrinkage. This rather imperfect microstructure can be a critical factor contributing to dendrite growth and might be another trigger for local SE cracking. Further attention and in-depth analyses need to be addressed to this issue, and this will be subject of future studies.

Ideally, a smooth SE separator surface without defects as well as an intimate interface with uniformly stripped and plated lithium would improve stable cycling. From the practical point of view, this brings numerous operational challenges. Once a lithium foil is used, the presence of the natural passivation layer on the lithium metal surface (mainly Li2CO3, LiOH and Li2O) has to be taken into account, as it surely has an impact on the interface with the SE, but is mostly ignored. Otto et al. [54,55] investigated the chemical composition of the passivation layer systematically, its evolution with storage time and its effect on the interfacial resistance of lithium metal anodes in contact with ceramic SEs. In addition, due to the high reactivity of Li metal in contact with Li6PS5Cl [53], a non-uniform interphase layer (SEI) forms in any case, potentially causing inhomogeneous Li stripping/plating. As Otto et al . have shown, the SEI of Li6PS5Cl can be as thick as 200 -300 nm after depositing a thin lithium metal layer (1 l m), which clearly adds to the mechanical instability of the SE surface [53]. These chemical issues complicate the picture but bring us back to the most essential problem, namely the low fracture toughness of the ceramic electrolyte.

One strategy to enhance the mechanical stability of the ceramic SE is to add mechanically stabilizing /uniFB01 bers -creating a ' /uniFB01 berreinforced ' SE separator. For the application in the ceramic electrolyte, the /uniFB01 bers should be chemically stable against lithium metal, electronically insulating and have high mechanical strength. To demonstrate the applicability of this strategy, 5 wt % Al2O3 /uniFB01 bers with high aspect ratio were incorporated into the Li6PS5Cl pellet as shown in Fig. S9, resulting in a uniform composite (Fig. 6a). A cross-section of the composite was prepared and characterized. As can be seen in Fig. S10, long Al2O3 /uniFB01 bers are uniformly distributed in the composite, despite the simple processing route, and the /uniFB01 bers appear undamaged. As the schematic image Fig. 6a shows, the /uniFB01 bers may increase the toughness of the brittle SE in the following two ways: a) bridging newly formed cracks, and b) increasing the stress for crack formation, as the pull-out of /uniFB01 bers during cracking consumes additional energy -depending on the interaction between SE and /uniFB01 ber surface. Both effects should mitigate cracking and slow down the crack propagation process [56]. We broke the Al2O3 enhanced ceramic composite and characterized the crosssection. As Fig. S10 shows, there are holes and pulled out /uniFB01 bers

along the cross-section. The process of forming these consumes more mechanical energy during cracking of the pellets, which increases the force required for both crack initiation and propagation during lithium /uniFB01 lament growth.

The CCD of the pure Li6PS5Cl and Al2O3 /uniFB01 ber-reinforced Li6PS5Cl is compared in Fig. 6b. With a step-wise increased current density, the Al2O3 /uniFB01 ber-reinforced Li6PS5Cl enabled a current density of 4.0 mA cm -2 . In contrast, the pure ceramic pellet without Al2O3 /uniFB01 bers only reached a CCD of 1.5 mA cm -2 . With a higher fracture toughness, the pellet enables a high cycle overpotential (as well as a high current according to Butler-Volmer equation), and the following equations show the relationship between overpotential and ceramic pellets ' fracture toughness [43]:

K Ic is the fracture toughness and y is a geometric factor, a is the length of the surface defect. A tougher ceramic pellet (high fracture toughness) enables a larger overpotential during plating. As Fig. 6b shows, the overpotential of a lithium symmetric cell with 5 wt% reaches 0.25 V before an internal short circuit occurs, which is around 2.5 times higher than the symmetric cell with pristine pellets. While need to mentioned, the introduction of insulator additive would increase the resistance of pellets slightly, as Fig. S11. Besides the CCD, the cycle stability of the two electrolytes was also compared. The cell with reinforced Li6PS5Cl could cycle for more than 350 h at 0.3 mA cm -2 for 0.3 mAh cm -2 , while the pure Li6PS5Cl only cycled for about around 50 h (Fig. 6c) before lithium /uniFB01 laments induced internal short circuit. The comparison of the electrochemical performance clearly demonstrates the improvement achieved by stabilizing the mechanical properties of the pellet just by adding Al2O3 /uniFB01 bers. The /uniFB01 ber reinforcement improves the mechanical properties, namely the fracture toughness, and might be a relatively simple and effective method. In his report, Athanasiou et al . detailed the use of rGO in Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 SE and the resulting achievement of high toughness [57]. However, the high electronic conductivity of rGO causes serious concerns about the potential formation of a conductive network inside the SE and bipolar effects causing internal metal deposition. Clearly, insulating /uniFB01 bers are the preferred option, and to the best of our knowledge, the concept of enhancing SE with insulator /uniFB01 bers has not been reported yet.

## Conclusions

The failure mechanism of a thick Li6PS5Cl separator pellet was carefully investigated with multiple characterization methods. A dedicated stack pressure control device was used for the operando SEM experiments. Cracks initiated by lithium metal plating were found to be the main failure mechanism for argyrodite based solid electrolyte separators. A coupled mechanism of crack propagation and lithium /uniFB01 lament growth leads to rapid cell failure. A subsequent in situ SEM experiment using micromanipulators and ex situ FIB-SEM measurements reveal that void formation and current constriction during repeated charge/discharge are two major reasons for cracking, in line with previous reports. Besides that, the imperfect surface of pellets with pores, which can act as ' pre-cracks ' , provide an easy ' entry ' for lithium metal ultimately leading to a hard short circuit of a cell. Generally, lithium metal modi /uniFB01 cation, surface modi /uniFB01 cation of the ceramic solid electrolyte or appropriate stack pressure will improve interfacial wetting and contact and achieve more homogeneous lithium metal stripping/plating. However, these strategies will not yield suf /uniFB01 cient performance improvement. After understanding the failure mechanism of ceramic electrolyte cracking, more attention should be paid to the mechanical properties of SEs and to concepts to increase the fracture toughness of ceramic electrolytes. We believe that our novel approach to reinforce the solid electrolyte mechanically by non-conductive additives may be one practical solution that can surely be further developed.

## Methods

## Electrochemical performance experiments

For the Al2O3 /uniFB01 ber-reinforced pellet, 5 wt% of Al2O3 /uniFB01 ber (3 M, USA) is added into the Li6PS5Cl powder (NEI Corporation, Somerset, NY, USA) and homogeneous mixed in a mortar. For cell construction, 200 mg Li6PS5Cl or Al2O3 /uniFB01 ber-reinforced Li6PS5Cl powder were densi /uniFB01 ed under 380 MPa for 3 mins in a homemade cell casing. Two pieces of lithium foil of 6 mm were then attached on both sides of the densi /uniFB01 ed pellets. A step-wise increased current density of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 2.5, /C1/C1/C1 , 8.5, 9.0, 10 mA cm -2 was applied for the CCD test. The galvanostatic cycles were run at a current density of 0.3 mA cm -2 for 0.3 mAh cm -2 (corresponding to 1.46 m mlithium) at a pressure of 15 MPa.

For the time-resolved EIS experiment, a stack pressure of 75 MPa was applied to the Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li cell in a home-made pressure device, in which a pressure sensor was used for pressure monitoring and a spring for keeping the pressure constant. EIS data (10 mV, 0.1 Hz /C0 3 MHz) were recorded with a VMP 300 (biologic) device every 1 h until an internal short circuit occurred.

## Operando scanning electron microscopy experiment with pressure control device

For the operando SEM experiment, 200 mg Li6PS5Cl powder (NEI Corporation, Somerset, NY, USA) was densi /uniFB01 ed under 380 MPa for 3 mins into an 8 mm diameter pellet and the pellet was then broken in two parts from the middle. In order to avoid small precracks due to the previous process, an additional densi /uniFB01 cation process with an isostatic pressure of 300 MPa was conducted to the half pellet for 10 mins. The surface of the cross section of the ceramic pellet was carefully polished with SiC polishing paper (P1000) before assembly in a symmetric Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li cell. The symmetric cell was mounted in a pressure control device (Deben, UK) (Fig. S1) after brief contact to atmosphere located in the SEM chamber, which was modi /uniFB01 ed to have electrical contacts on the pressing stamps. Before the galvanostatic cycle, the stack pressure was set to 1 MPa to avoid damage to the pellets induced by a high stack pressure in this partially open closed cell system. Additionally, a low stack pressure was desired for practical SSB purposes. An increasing current density of of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4,

0.6, 0.8 and 1.2 mA cm -2 was set for the cycles. During the galvanostatic cycling, the evolution of the cross section was recorded every 0.5 s per frame with an electron beam voltage 3 kV (the Carl Zeiss Ultra /uniFB01 eld emission SEM instrument, Merlin.).

## In situ scanning electron microscopy lithium plating experiment with micromanipulators

For the in situ lithium plating experiment on the surface of Li6PS5Cl pellet, a microelectrode module (prober module, Kammrath &amp; Weiss GmbH) was used inside the SEM chamber (Merlin, Carl Zeiss). The microelectrode could be precisely controlled with the movement in x , y , and z direction by a control unit outside the chamber, thus enabling an ultra-high vacuum experiment condition. The schematic setup is shown in Fig. S6.

For the sample preparation, 200 mg argyrodite powder was densi /uniFB01 ed under 380 MPa for 3 mins and Li metal foil was attached on one side of the pellet. For an intimate contact between lithium metal foil and argyrodite pellet, an additional isostatic pressure of 200 MPa was applied for 10 mins. To avoid the reaction with ambient air, the Leica transfer system (EM VCT500, Leica) was used to transfer the sample from an argon protected glovebox to the SEM chamber, where the microelectrode module was /uniFB01 rst placed. To de /uniFB01 ne the plating current density, a thin Au layer with controlled size was deposited on the pellet surface, as shown in Fig. S12. Before the galvanostatic plating process, the tungsten microelectrode was carefully placed on the Au layer area on the argyrodite pellet without penetrating it. A step-wise increased current was applied from 10 l A to 1268 l A (Biologic SP-150). The whole plating process was recorded 0.5 s per frame.

## Ex situ focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy

The evolution of the Li|Li6PS5Cl interface after galvanostatic cycling was investigated ex situ with the FIB SEM. The pellet was cold sintered with high uniaxial pressure of 380 MPa in a home-made PEEK cell casing, and lithium metal foil and copper foil were placed such as to construct a Cu|Li|Li6PS5Cl|Li|Cu symmetric sandwich structure. Before galvanostatic cycling, a stack pressure of 50 MPa was applied for 30 mins to generate an intimate interface contact. During the cycling, the stack pressure was set to 5 MPa and current density is 0.3 mA cm -2 at 0.3 mAh cm -2 . After an internal short circuit had occurred, the cell was disassembled in an argon/uniFB01 lled glovebox and transferred into a TESCAN XEIA3 system (TESCAN GmbH) equipped with Xe plasma FIB column. For decreasing the damage due to the ion milling and polishing, a cryo-system with liquid nitrogen cooling was applied during the whole experiment. Since there was already one thin layer of copper (around 20 l m) above the Li metal, no additional protection layer was deposited. The ion beam voltage was 30 kV and the current for milling was set to 130 nA and 8 nA for polishing in all experiments. To capture the pristine interface morphology, the cell was disassembled and characterized after applying stack pressure at 50 MPa for 30 mins.
