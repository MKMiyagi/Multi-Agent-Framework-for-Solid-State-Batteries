## Li6PS5Cl microstructure and influence on dendrite growth in solid-state batteries with lithium metal anode

Dendrite growth in solid-state batteries is strongly correlated with stress initiation at the interface and subsequent stress propagation/shielding in the electrolyte bulk. Through the grain size distribution of the solid electrolyte separator, Singh et al. show that the anode interface and bulk electrolyte microstructure can be tailored, which influences the critical current density.

## SUMMARY

Enabling lithium metal is key toward maximizing the energy density of solid-state batteries (SSBs) with a solid electrolyte (SE) as the separator. However, the formation of pores at the Li ǀ SE interface during stripping and short-circuiting during cathodic plating through dendrite growth hinder stable cycling at higher current density. The interface and bulk microstructure of SEs govern the dendrite growth mechanism and hence the maximum or critical current density (CCD) an SE can sustain before shorting. Herein, via the control of the grain size of Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl), we show that interface and bulk microstructure can be simultaneously tailored to significantly influence the CCD. Based on the microstructure-strength relationship, we discuss mechanical failure mechanisms in SSBs derived from correlations between focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM and electrochemical data analyses. We propose that the microstructural influence on local current density and dendrite growth is well connected to the concept of crack growth resistance, or ''R curve behavior,'' observed in certain materials.

## INTRODUCTION

Inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) with high ionic conductivity comparable to that of liquid electrolytes, when combined with a lithium metal anode ( q th = 3,860 mAh g /C0 1 ), promise to increase the energy density of electrochemical energy storage systems with enhanced safety and a prolonged cycle life. 1,2 However, the rate capabilities of solid-state batteries (SSBs) generally are still lower (0.1-1 mA cm /C0 2 ) than those of the conventional lithium ion batteries (1-3 mA cm /C0 2 ). 3-6 Recently, there have been more reports on improved rate capability at room temperature. 7,8

SE fracture and subsequent shorting driven by lithium electrodeposition (often noted as plating)-even at much lower current densities-is a major hurdle in the development of SSBs. Any successful approach must consider the mechanical properties and stability of SEs. Engineering Li ǀ SE interfaces in terms of interfacial flaws has been shown to enhance the mechanical endurance of SEs against dendrite growth and equivalently to increase the critical current density (CCD), the maximum current density a system can stand prior to shorting. 8 Clearly, the CCD is a function of interfacial as well as bulk characteristics of SEs. Hence, it is important to consider the fracture toughness, K IC, a material property that takes into account both interfacial and bulk effects, as well as its influence on dendrite growth, in the design and development of mechanically robust SE systems. The dynamic nature of Li ǀ SE interfaces has led to the belief that interfacial processes primarily govern the failure

mechanisms in SSBs. 8-11 While this may be sufficient to understand specific situations, only a few studies consider bulk microscopic anisotropic properties such as grain size, shape, orientation, and porosity distribution of the SE as such. 12,13 The complex electrochemomechanical dynamics in lithium metal SSBs demands model-type experiments that help to establish a fundamental blueprint in predictive cell failure analyses. 6,14-18

The determination of the stress distribution in an SE is complicated by two issues, which can only in rare cases be considered individually. First, the internal microstructure of the SE is often neglected by assuming that it can be sufficiently well described as a homogeneous solid. The non-continuum nature of the SE on the mesoscale determines its mechanical properties, such as its fracture toughness, which determines the ease of formation and propagation of cracks and dendrites. Second, the roughness of the Li|SE interface and the resulting interfacial stress determine the initial conditions for stripping and plating of lithium metal.

Therefore, the mechanistic understanding of cell failure mechanisms in SSBs requires knowledge of the interface morphology, grain size, and mechanical properties of the SE. The homogeneity of the initial interfacial stress strongly depends on the interfacial properties, such as the roughness or the defect population in the ceramic. The subsequent response, i.e., the propagation of stress, is governed by the size, shape, and relative crystallographic orientations of the grains in the bulk of the SE. 19,20 The degree of bulk microstructural elastic anisotropy defines the effectiveness of stress dissipation and stress distribution in the ceramic.

Among the studied interfaces in SSBs, Li ǀ Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) is relatively less explored in terms of the influence of interfacial structure and bulk microscopic properties of the SE on CCD compared with the extensively investigated Li ǀ Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) interfaces. 21,22 However, the high and well-reproducible ionic conductivity of LPSCl (&gt;1 mS cm /C0 1 ) can facilitate higher power densities. 23 The synthetic protocols of LPSCl are less stringent, more flexible, and far less energy intensive compared with LLZO, which requires high-temperature sintering. This easily allows industrialscale production of LPSCl. Also, it has favorable mechanical properties (lower Pugh's ratio, i.e., G / B of 0.28, where G and B are shear modulus and bulk modulus, respectively) 24,25 that allow better electrode-electrolyte contacts at moderate pressures and room temperature. Thus, mechanical processability would enable large-scale thin-film fabrication. Therefore, LPSCl offers several advantages, which makes it an attractive candidate from the industrial perspective for the development of SSBs.

In the present paper, we varied the surface roughness and the bulk microstructure of LPSCl separator pellets by cold isostatic compaction of LPSCl powders with different mean grain sizes at a pressure of 362 MPa. The microstructural variation allows control over the stress distribution within the SE and enhances the mechanical stability and integrity of the ceramic phase. This is especially relevant when the stresses are generated internally and are highly localized. As a corollary to grain size control over interfacial defect population, we show that cell cycling also affects the microscopic stress propagation and distribution pathways in SEs. Our study of Li ǀ LPSCl interfaces has two main parts: at first, we investigate the contact mechanics during the initial process of contacting lithium with the SE separator. Second, we highlight how cell cycling changes the interfacial and bulk electrochemomechanical dynamics and influences the CCD dependent on the grain size of the SE.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## Surface morphology

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to compare the grain size of LPSCl qualitatively (Figure S1). Most grains of small-grained LPSCl (SG-LPSCl) and largegrained LPSCl (LG-LPSCl) showed grain sizes of &lt;500 nm (SG-LPSCl) and /C24 20-40 m m (LG-LPSCl). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns confirmed the phase purity of the powders (Figure S2). The domain-size-induced broadening of reflections for SG-LPSCl indicates a smaller grain size (Figure S2A). The ionic conductivities of SG-LPSCl and LG-LPSCl separators were determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to be s ion (SG) = 1.56 ( G 0.11) mS cm /C0 1 and s ion (LG) = 1.95 ( G 0.14) mS cm /C0 1 at 298 K (Figure S3). The respective activation energies for Li + transport were found to be E a (SG) = 0.35 eV for SG-LPSCl and E a (LG) = 0.37 eV for LG-LPSCl (Figure S3D).

Surface topography was investigated to quantify the root-mean-square surface roughness, R q, of both types of separators. Confocal microscopy images reveal R q to be 1.1 and 6.5 m mfor SG-LPSCl and LG-LPSCl, respectively (Figure 1). The higher R q for LG-LPSCl can be understood by inspecting the optical images (Figure S4A). The pre-cleaning step involves grit polishing with CarbiMet 1000 polishing paper (P2500), which introduces scratches on the surface (Figure S4A) and thereby increases R q from its native state (please refer to the supplemental experimental procedures for details). The opposite holds true for LG-LPSCl (Figure S4B), since these separators show a higher R q in their native state and, by polishing the separator surface, native asperities are reduced in height.

## Contacts at Li ǀ SE interface: Intact versus modified interfacial structures

The necessity to attain optimal interfacial contact at the Li ǀ SE interface demands the application of sufficient stress. 26,27 Conformal interfacial contact requires an intricate interplay between the applied load and the appropriate mechanical properties of the solids involved. The surface roughness of these solids additionally modulates the contact. 27,28 On account of higher stiffness of ceramics, the applied stress to a lithium-ceramic interface would cause much higher elastic strain in the compliant lithium metal phase on account of its much lower bulk Young's modulus ( E = 7.8 GPa). 29 Therefore, at any given stress, the larger the difference between the elastic moduli of SE and the lithium metal, the larger is the strain in the lithium. Increasing the stress beyond the yield strength results in the plastic deformation of lithium if s applied &gt; s y ( z 0.8 MPa) 29 and if the critical stress ( s f) required to reach fracture toughness of the SE K IC is not exceeded ( s y &lt; s applied &lt; s f for K IC). An example of an SE where lithium flows into the SE surface is the Li ǀ LLZO interface ( E (LLZO)) = 175.0 GPa, Pugh's ratio of 0.54, and K IC = 1.25 MPa m 1/2 ), as shown

(A) Application of stress to the Li ǀ LLZO interface results in a microscopically flat interface as the applied stress primarily results in the plastic flow of lithium.

(B) The load applied to the Li ǀ LPSCl interface results in a compromised interfacial structure, which results from highly correlative effects depending on the applied stress s applied, the elastic constants of both phases, the fracture toughness, and the surface roughness. This leads to lithium protrusions in unfavorable geometrical configurations, such as crack-like defects, sharp-edged slits, or wedges. The dotted region (red) indicates the dynamic evolution of an interfacial region due to the restructuring of an existing flaw via loading in mode I.

(C) An unfavorable lithium protrusion will load the SE in mode I during cathodic lithium deposition. After the dendrite initiation at the interface, the dendrite propagation is governed by the bulk microstructural characteristics of the SE.

schematically in Figure 2A. 22,30-32 The microscopically flat LLZO surface aids its mechanical integrity. 22

The interfacial stress-strain relation becomes more complicated when (1) Young's moduli of the materials in contact do not differ much, (2) the SEs have low fracture toughness, and (3) surface roughness is present. An example of such an interface is the case of Li ( E (Li) = 7.8 GPa) and LPSCl ( E (LPSCl) = 22 GPa, Pugh's ratio = 0.28, and KIC = 0.23 MPa m 1/2 for Li2S-P2S5) as shown in Figure 2B. 25,29,32 Initially, the two surfaces touch only at protruding asperities (Figure 2B). At t &gt; 0 s, and for s applied &gt; s y, lithium adjusts by plastic flow to the surface roughness of LPSCl, which leads to a heterogeneous distribution of lithium protrusions with contact gaps in the vicinity of these protrusions. Conformal interfacial contact, when s applied R s y is expected only for atomically smooth surfaces. However, the presence of a finite surface roughness demands s applied &gt;&gt; s y, and also, the magnitude of s applied required for conformal contact is further governed by the micromechanical properties of lithium. In fact, the yield strength of micrometer-sized lithium is about one order of magnitude higher ( s y (Li-micrometer) = 105 MPa for ⌀ = 1.39 m m) 33 compared with bulk

Also, dotted lines in (E) and (I) indicate the geometrical configuration of the flaw introduced into the ceramic structure.

lithium ( s y z 0.8 MPa). Therefore, the ratio s applied / s y is also governed by the surface roughness of the SE.

Concurrently, lithium protrusions and the resulting load inhomogeneity at the Li| LPSCl interface leads to a local exceeding of K IC for SE and thus to local brittle fracture following fracture mechanics ''mode I'' failure (the largest principal stress being oriented perpendicular to the crack surface; see Figure S5). Thereafter, fracture and conformity are attained simultaneously, resulting in an interdigitated interfacial structure (Figure 2B). This local interface morphology causes a highly inhomogeneous current distribution under cathodic load, exerting high stresses ( s dendrite ) and locally opening up the mode I loading scenario (Figure S5). Thereafter, the bulk microstructure of the SE governs the dendrite propagation (Figure 2C).

## Cross-sectional FIB-SEM images of the interface morphology

To document the interface morphology better, cross-sectional analyses were performed in different regions of the assembled cells, i.e., Li ǀ SG/LG-LPSCl ǀ Li (fabricated at an isostatic pressure of 265 MPa), using focused ion beam (FIB)-SEM. The SEM images reveal that the surface topography of a lithium-free region in an LG-LPSCl pellet (Figure 3F) is more corrugated compared with SG-LPSCl (Figure 3A), which corroborates with Figures 1A and 1B. Cross-sectional analyses of a lithium-free region shows that the applied isostatic stress (265 MPa) does not alter the grain size of either SE, as was estimated from the size of the grains close to the surface

OPEN ACCESS

(Figures 3B-3G). Therefore, the surface roughness, in either case, is proportional to the grain size (Figures 1A, 1B, 3A, 3B, 3F, and 3G).

The FIB-SEM view of a symmetrically dispositioned region (indicated by ''b'' in the inset schematic) in-between the two electrodes, representing a region in LPSCl that was under a uniform hydrostatic stress during compression, indicates nearly intact grains (Figures 3C-3H). 34 The magnified view (Figure 3D) of a region in Figure 3C indicates the presence of pores in SG-LPSCl (lower density /C24 83%) (please refer to the supplemental experimental procedures for details). Figures 3E-3I depict the interfacial profiles of Li ǀ SG-LPSCl and Li ǀ LG-LPSCl. Extensive interfacial restructuring is observed for Li ǀ LG-LPSCl on account of grain fracture resulting in a highly interdigitated interface due to higher load inhomogeneity. Such a feature is absent in any other region of the cell (Figures 3G and 3H). Lower load inhomogeneity due to smaller R q in SG-LPSCl results in the generation of more dense and wider pores at the interface compared with the bulk or lithium-free regions (Figures 3B-3D). 35 Thus, at the interface, stresses through lithium have different effects on interfacial and bulk morphology depending on the grain size of LPSCl.

## Stress concentration and fracture toughness

The origin of such interfacial structures (Figures 3E-3I) can be understood by considering the flaw sensitivity of the ceramics, i.e., lower fracture toughness, K IC, and the mechanical response of metals. Metals channel the absorbed energy via plastic flow (glide through slip planes), whereas ceramics dissipate stresses via brittle fracture. 36 Flaws are stress concentrators, and in the elastic limit, the stress s max at the crack tip is defined as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where s 0 is the applied stress, ɑ is the crack length, and r is the radius of curvature of the tip (Figure S6). The stress concentration factor K c at the tip is then expressed as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Generally, ɑ &gt;&gt; r and hence s max &gt;&gt; s 0.

Equation 1 reveals that a larger and sharper crack (smaller radius of curvature, r ) increases the local stress. Thus, while the nominal stress area may be lower than the fracture toughness, the local stress can exceed it and lead to fracture. Figures 1A, 1B, 3A, 3B, 3F, and 3G indicate that for a given stress, K c is always higher at the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interface.

According to linear-elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), the failure criterion for loading in mode I results from the combination of load and flaw size and is given by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Here, s f is the failure load at a critical crack length a c (equivalent to surface flaws), Y is a geometry factor taking into account the influence of crack geometry, and g and E are surface energy and Young's modulus, respectively. The term on the left-hand side of Equation 3 is referred to as the stress intensity factor, KI , whereas the righthand term is referred to as the critical stress intensity factor or, more commonly, fracture toughness, KIC . Therefore, the fracture criterion can be compactly written as:

KI R KIC :

(Equation 6)

Through Equation (6), the surface roughness directly translates into K I, and the preceding arguments indicate that K I ( LG-LPSCl ) &gt; K I ( SG-LPSCl ) leads to extensive interfacial intergranular/transgranular fracture (Figures 3E-3I) at much lower loads for LG-LPSCl. Also, load inhomogeneity at fewer asperities further worsens the situation in LG-LPSCl. The stochastic distribution of prominent flaws in the resulting interface is evident from Figures 3E-3I. This strongly influences the electrochemically generated mechanical stress at the interface during cathodic electrodeposition, as discussed later. 37,38 The comparison of a pre-existing surface flaw of 14 m m length along with a sharper tip (Figure 3G) in LG-LPSCl with a smoother surface profile in SG-LPSCl (Figures 3A and 3B) aptly describes the different thresholds (Equations 3 and 4). Therefore, the probability of local fracture survival at a given nominal stress is higher for SG-LPSCl. Nevertheless, uniform stress at the Li ǀ SGLPSCl interface results in preferential interfacial pore generation via microstructure readjustment by grain displacement in the vicinity (Figure 3E). Therefore, the interface and the bulk are in different stress states in SG-LPSCl and LG-LPSCl during isostatic compression. The interfacial structure is mediated by the grain size, and the two sizes have distinct features, whereas the bulk microstructure largely remains unaffected (Figure 3).

## Pressure effects on electrochemical response

To get insights into the roughness-modulated contact as a function of initially applied stress, i.e., 20, 120, and 265 MPa (isostatic compression during cell fabrication), potentiostatic electrochemical impedance spectra (PEIS) of symmetric cells were obtained at open circuit voltage (OCV) (Figures 4 and S7). As already discussed above, no stack pressure was applied in addition to the atmospheric pressure to probe s dendrite exclusively. The pressure selection was based on the fact that a stress of 20 MPa (larger than s y z 0.8 MPa) 29 would lead to good contact in the absence of any surface roughness. 27 In the presence of roughness and given that the hypotheses of load inhomogeneity and micromechanical properties of lithium are true, then perfect contact will be attained only for smaller roughness, i.e., for SG-LPSCl. A pressure of 265 MPa is an extreme situation wherein the contact will no longer be limited by either surface roughness or the micromechanical properties of lithium.

Nyquist plots (Figure 4C) of either cell, i.e., Li ǀ SG-LPSCl|Li or Li|LG-LPSCl ǀ Li, fabricated at 265 MPa show a single semicircle without any interface resistance, indicating the absence of any impedance contribution due to pressure issues. The spectra are fitted with an equivalent circuit consisting of a parallel combination of resistor ( R ) and constant phase element (CPE) as shown in the inset of Figure 4C. This is assigned to bulk transport based on the capacitance value of /C24 3-6 3 10 /C0 11 F. 39 A comparison between impedance spectra from the cells fabricated at 20 MPa (Figure 4A) and 265 MPa (Figure 4C) indicates an incomplete contact at the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interface (indicated by the double-headed red arrow in Figure 4A) for the former cell (Figure 4D). Then, according to Ohm's law, the difference between the real axis intercepts, i.e., D Z 0 = Z 0 (20 MPa) /C0 Z 0 (265 MPa), of the high-frequency semicircle (fitted according to the equivalent circuits shown in the inset of Figures 4A-4C) gives /C24 14% less contact area for the 20 MPa cell. The additional low-frequency component ( R /C24 30 U ) in Figure 4A is attributed to the interface process, R interface ( C /C24 10 /C0 8 F). This can be attributed to the constriction resistance, R constriction (Figure 4G). 40-43 Also, due to the load inhomogeneity, and lower applied pressure, a different contact situation exists at the interface (Figure 4G). We believe

that the surfaces that are not in optimum range of interaction can also hinder charge transfer (Figure 4G). Being perfect in range, interacting surfaces do not show any interface resistance (Figure 4C). Thus, it is not a property of a perfect interface as such (Figure 4C), but rather depends on the microstructure of the interface. We name this resistance as charge-transfer (CT) resistance ( R CT), as CT is kinetically hindered. Whether this kinetic hindrance is due to a true CT effect or a constriction effect due to a restricted contact area cannot be resolved by impedance spectroscopy. We, therefore, denote R interface = R constriction (+ R CT). Similar analyses reveal D Z 0 z 0 U for SG-LPSCl, indicating comparable contact areas at both pressures (Figures 4A-4C), although with an additional interface resistance derived from the low-frequency semicircle (R /C24 47 U ) in Figure 4A. This can be explained by a lower load inhomogeneity at the Li ǀ SG-LPSCl interface (Figures 4D-4F).

Also, the pre-processing lithium step (please refer to the supplemental experimental procedures for details) induces a significant amount of work hardening 36 in lithium metal, which results in higher yield strength s y. Therefore, the coupled effects of external stress during cell fabrication (20 MPa), load inhomogeneity, and a higher yield strength s y leads to contacts over a wider area at the Li ǀ SG-LPSCl interface compared with Li ǀ LG-LPSCl. 22,44

Similarly, cells that were fabricated at 120 MPa show an incomplete contact of /C24 9% ( /C24 0.033 cm 2 less contact area on either side) at the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interface along with the absence of interface resistance, R interface (Figures 4B-4E). This indicates that the contact area increases at 120 MPa, and the interface is free of constrictions, and the gaps between adjacent asperities lead to lower contact area due to the inhomogeneous lithium flow (Figure 4E). The Nyquist plot for a Li ǀ SG-LPSCl|Li cell fabricated at 120 MPa (Figure 4B) indicates nearly similar contact area without any interface resistance R interface, suggesting a constriction-free interface (Figure 4C). Therefore, good interfacial contact by bringing surfaces into the range of interaction 45 is connected to the surface roughness, strain hardening, and micromechanical properties of lithium and the applied stress. 46,47

## Interfacial effects on unidirectional electrochemical stripping and plating

To understand the temporal evolution of the interface morphology, continuous unidirectional galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectra (GEIS) of symmetric cells fabricated with a pressure of 265 MPa (Li ǀ SG-LPSCl ǀ Li and Li ǀ LG-LPSCl ǀ Li) were measured at a current density of 0.2 mA cm /C0 2 . GEIS allow the tracking of the temporal evolution of the cell impedance during current load. 22 The measurement time for a single spectrum was approximately 39 s. Nyquist plots of selected spectra depict the progressive increase of the interfacial impedance for both systems (Figures 5A and 5B). A comparison with Figure 4C reveals the steady buildup of an additional impedance contribution, which originates from progressive contact loss on the stripping side and becomes increasingly prominent toward longer time scales ( t &gt;8h). This results in modified impedance spectra due to the frequency dependence of potential/current lines at such conditions of current constriction. 40,41,43,48,49 From the data obtained, the temporal evolution of R interface can be determined by evaluating the difference between the interfacial resistances at the very beginning of the experiments ( R interface,0) and the n th impedance spectra ( R interface, n ). This difference in R interface can serve as a measure for the continuous contact loss on the stripping side (Figure 5D).

The corresponding cell voltage profiles in Figure 5C indicate that the potential rises suddenly after /C24 15.4 h for both cells. The amount of lithium stripped up to this time

Comparing the two cells, contact loss can be identified as the dominant process in the SG-LPSCl cell after /C24 15.4 h.

(A and B) The flaws present at the Li|LG-LPSCl interface (B) are sharper and deeper compared with the Li|SG-LPSCl interface (A). This leads to preferential lithium deposition via current focusing. The comparatively smooth interfacial profile of the Li|SG-LPSCl interface in (A) leads to uniform lithium deposition across the interface and thereby avoids pronounced current focusing.

/C24 15.6 h followed by a sudden drop in potential, indicating a short circuit. The result reiterates the influence of grain parameters in the functioning of SSBs and cell failure via (1) contact loss and (2) short-circuiting. Figure 5E shows schematically the two dominant failure modes for SG-LPSCl and LG-LPSCl, respectively. The dotted lines in Figure 5E indicate the dendrite or equivalently the microcrack propagation in the bulk microstructure. It is to be noted that dendrite advance per unit length is smaller in the SG-LPSCl bulk compared with LG-LPSCl, which is discussed in detail in the later part of the article.

As current focusing was pointed out to be an important aspect for describing the failure mechanism in LG-LPSCl, finite element analysis (FEA) of the extracted interfacial FIB-SEM profiles (Figures 3I and 7B) was conducted (Figure 6). The results indicate comparatively intense current focusing at sharper, unfavorable geometries present at the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interface (Figure 6B). This current focusing results in preferential lithium growth at these points. 50,51 The corresponding current distribution at the Li ǀ SG-LPSCl interface is more homogeneous compared with the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interface, resulting in a more uniform lithium deposition (Figure 6A). As lithium preferentially grows along grain boundaries, the growth of dendrites is more pronounced in LG-LPSCl due to current focusing and larger grain sizes. 52,53 The tortuosity created by grain boundaries in SG-LPSCl would couple with the above factor, resulting in a smaller Li advancement per unit distance into the bulk matrix. Therefore, the electrochemically generated mechanical stress will be much more uniformly distributed at the Li ǀ SG-LPSCl interface compared with Li ǀ LG-LPSCl.

To correlate the observed electrochemical behavior with microstructural properties, postmortem analyses of GEIS-tested symmetric cells were carried out with FIB-SEM. It is important to consider the different interface profiles for the two types of cells (Figure 7). For the Li|SG-LPSCl interface, a clear demarcation of phases is found (Figure 7A), which can be considered as a sharp interface. In contrast, the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl

interface shows an interdigitated structure (Figures 7E and 7F). 54 Cross-sectional images of the Li ǀ SG-LPSCl interface reveal contact loss at the stripped interface (Figures 7A-7C), while conformal contact was observed at the plated side (Figures 7B-7D), in accordance with the electrochemical data (Figures 5A-5C). Similar analyses of Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interfaces (Figures 7E and 7F) indicate intact conformal contacts on both sides, well in line with the explanation for the short circuit observed in electrochemical experiments (Figures 5B and 5C).

## Critical current density test

After studying the formed contact at the Li ǀ SG/LG-LPSCl interfaces as well as the impact of surface roughness and microstructure on experiments under a unidirectional current, stripping-plating cycles were used to assess the CCD in symmetric Li ǀ SG/LG-LPSCl|Li cells. For this, lithium was attached to SE pellets at different isostatic pressures (20, 120, and 265 MPa) during cell fabrication. This provides mechanistic insights into how contacts that reduce in size during electrochemical stripping lead to different failure pathways as a function of the initially applied stress, i.e., via contact loss and/or short-circuiting. The cells were cycled at different current densities between 0.1 and 1.8 mA cm /C0 2 . The testing was performed with a constant charge of 0.3 mAh cm /C0 2 , which corresponds to /C24 1.45 m m thickness of homogeneously deposited/dissolved lithium. A cut-off voltage of 5.0 V was set as a safety limit. From Figure 8, it is evident that SG-LPSCl withstands higher current densities compared with LG-LPSCl, especially at higher preparation pressures.

The CCD response of 20 MPa cells reveals the effects of the effective contact area and the range of interaction (Figures 8A and 8B). The voltage response is dominated by contact loss in both cases (SG- and LG-LPSCl), as can be seen from the sloping potential profile (d V /d t s 0) beginning at 0.4 mA cm /C0 2 . This contact loss as well as a rough interface led to local current focusing so that the potential profiles

obtained from LG-LPSCl become more irregular than the ones obtained from SGLPSCl. In the latter, a more uniform current distribution over larger interfacial contacts yields improved data quality.

Increasing the cell fabrication pressure to 120 MPa also affects the results of CCD tests, as can be seen by comparing Figures 8C and 8D with the corresponding Figures 8A and 8B. By applying larger cell fabrication pressures, the potential profiles in CCD tests remain constant (d V /d t z 0) for higher current densities. The difference between potentials measured under the same current densities but with opposite current direction becomes smaller if larger cell fabrication pressures are used. Also, the potential changes that are observed by increasing the current density are less pronounced compared with cells that were fabricated with a pressure of 20 MPa. These observations hold for both SG- and LG-LPSCl, indicating a better interfacial contact, a more uniform current distribution, and a slowly receding range of interaction during the CCD tests. 45

At perfect interfacial contacts, achieved at 265 MPa cell fabrication pressure, both LG-LPSCl and SG-LPSCl cells indicate failure via short-circuiting at current densities of 0.4 and 0.9 mA cm /C0 2 , respectively. For LG-LPSCl, the difference in the corresponding potentials for current densities % 0.3 mA cm /C0 2 are the lowest ( /C24 57.0% lower compared with the results obtained from cells that were fabricated with a pressure of 20 MPa). This indicates good interfacial contact. The corresponding potential values are similar for SG-LPSCl cells prepared at 20 MPa.

Interestingly, unlike in the cases in which cell fabrication pressures of 20 and 120 MPa were used, the slope of the potential profile (d V /d t ) increases even at lower current densities of 0.2 mA cm /C0 2 for LG-LPSCl cells that were prepared at a pressure of 265 MPa. This slope also becomes progressively larger if the current density is increased (Figure 8E). This indicates that a highly interdigitated interface for LG-LPSCl, as is shown in Figures 3I and 6B, leads to differential contact loss, with the progressive accumulation of poor contacts on both sides further contributing to the cause. Also, the finite rate constant of the CT at higher current densities as well as diffusion limitations inside lithium further contribute to a poor interfacial contact. This effect is accumulative, meaning that bad contacts tend to become worse. A similar effect is also seen when SG-LPSCl and current densities &lt;0.3 mA cm /C0 2 are used (see Figure 8E). Also, here, this observation points toward a somewhat rougher interface and an inhomogeneous contact loss. This is evident from Figure 3E, indicating a rough interface. This accumulation of bad contacts along with an increase in the range of interaction at a greater number of contact points subsequently results in a short circuit via cathodic current focusing.

Therefore, the potential profiles before cell failure are an indicator of a conformal interfacial structure and homogeneous interfacial current distribution. It is also apparent that the interfacial contacts influence the CCD. Also, failure modes in Figures 8E and 8F indicate that higher stresses help in mechanical anchoring by forming an interdigitated interface (Figures 3, 8E, and 8F) and thereby leading to slower changes in the total contact area. 54 However, the effect is negated for SEs with low K IC having larger grain size. The origin of the higher mechanical endurance of SG-LPSCl is discussed later in detail.

## Microstructural response during cathodic deposition

In the beginning, i.e., at t /C24 0 s, stresses are initiated into the SE at the Li ǀ LPSCl interface through lithium electrodeposition. From the CCD tests, it is evident that current focusing and inhomogeneous cathodic lithium deposition lead to short-circuiting. Progressive lithium deposition at the surface flaws leads to an accumulation of stress until a critical threshold s C is reached. 37,38,55 When the local stress exerted by a lithium protrusion reaches a subcritical threshold, which is related to a critical energy release rate G IC (Equation 7), the crack will propagate: 56

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Within the context of this article, a corresponds to the size of the flaw equivalent to interfacial roughness, E is Young's modulus, and g is the surface energy of the SE.

Due to the higher interface roughness at the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interface, s C is reached at a lower amount of deposited lithium than at the Li ǀ SG-LPSCl interface (Equations 5-7). 56,57 Also, dendrites are easily initiated at the Li ǀ LG-LPSCl interface due to preferential current focusing at certain isolated strained hot spots (separated by a distance of /C24 30-60 m m, Figure 6B). In contrast, uniform current distribution and stresses way below s C for a given charge passed lead to a higher mechanical endurance toward dendrite growth at the Li ǀ SG-LPSCl interface. Further propagation of the dendrite into the SE is governed by its bulk microstructure-stress interaction as discussed below. 58,59

There are several types of stress-shielding mechanisms in the bulk. Crack deflection causes stress dissipation and its reorientation when a growing crack is interacting with an obstacle, e.g., precipitates with larger Young's modulus, compressive

Stress-shielding mechanisms: a function of bulk microstructural characteristics of the SE (A-C) (A) Crack deflection, (B) crack bridging, and (C) elastic anisotropy due to varying grain orientation (indicated by colored coordinates), affecting the local microstress distribution in the vicinity of the propagating dendrite. GB, grain boundary.

stresses, etc. These interactions tend to partially unload the crack locally, thereby increasing K IC. Since Young's modulus of the material in a grain boundary region E GB is around one to two orders of magnitude lower compared with Young's modulus of the grain interior E GI , 60 the grain boundaries serve as energetically favorable pathways for stress propagation and dendrite growth. 53,61-64 Thus, grain boundaries govern the microstress distribution and dissipation in the bulk microstructure of a solid. 65 Assuming the crystallites are hexagonal prismatic, then to a first approximation, the triple-junction (TJ) density in SG-LPSCl (0.25 3 10 2 m m /C0 2 ) is more than three orders of magnitude higher than that in LGLPSCl (0.34 3 10 /C0 2 m m /C0 2 ). This implies that extensive short-ranged TJ branching in SG-LPSCl with an average grain size between 200 and 500 nm acts as a barrier to dendrite propagation. By this, any path for the growth of dendrites is continuously deflected, while the generated stress is simultaneously minimized and channeled into a new direction. This mechanism is equivalent to crack deflection, 56,57,66 i.e., enhancing the fracture toughness K IC via energy dissipation (Figure 9A). Such a stress-shielding mechanism is quantitatively expressed by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where K app and K tip are stress intensity factors when stresses are directed normal to the plane of the crack and at an arbitrary angle q , which is defined as the angle of deflection or equivalently the angle between grain boundaries. Clearly, K tip is always smaller than K app. 57,66,67 Also it is to be noted that crack deflection can also result in crack branching, wherein the advancing crack is simultaneously branched into a number of smaller microcracks in different directions. The microstructure of SGLPSCl would further favor this kind of mechanism. This stress-shielding mechanism further tends to enhance the fracture toughness of a material.

Therefore, stresses are uniformly distributed in SG-LPSCl so that s c is exceeded at higher pressures only. In contrast, the microstructure of LG-LPSCl allows unabated intense stress accumulation along fewer available paths. 68 This leads to an effective reduction in the size of the critical flaw ( a in Equation 7) in SG-LPSCl. The critical threshold s c differs as well in both systems and leads to smaller dendrite advancement per unit distance or to a lower shift rate of any stress state in SG-LPSCl for the same charge passed, as evident from CCD tests (Figure 8). Also, uniform current distribution and dense lithium dendrite growth pathways in SG-LPSCl lead to a higher backflow of lithium, 55 which further reduces the stress.

Short-circuiting at higher current densities represents a scenario of bulk microstructural frustration led by the competition between the rates of interfacial stress

generation and the bulk stress-dissipation ability via available stress-shielding pathways. Therefore, strain rates for a given amount of charge q are intense and localized in LG-LPSCl. 68 The microstructure in LG-LPSCl appears to possess characteristics of a non-linear dynamic system. These involve catastrophic and fast evolution of stress and strain at the time of failure, self-organized criticality, and dynamic chaos, 69 as failure occurs at much lower current densities (0.4 mA cm /C0 2 ) compared with SGLPSCl (0.9 mA cm /C0 2 ) (Figures 8D-8F).

The effect of porosity and its role in stress shielding via crack bridging is discussed next. The experiments were not designed to address the impact of porosity on the mechanical stability of SEs in a systematic fashion. The differences between SGLPSCl and LG-LPSCl and the consequences already discussed above can easily superimpose different effects originating from differences in porosity. But the CCD response indicates that SG-LPSCl with a higher porosity of /C24 17% exhibits a higher mechanical endurance toward electrochemically generated stresses compared with LG-LPSCl with a porosity of /C24 8% (Figures 8C-8F). Although porosity is a strength-deterrent factor (Equation 9), 70-72 the CCD indicates a critical strengthporosity-microstructure relation under the conditions of an internally generated dynamic stress scenario. It has been observed that strength and porosity have the following relationship: 70,72

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where s p and s 0 are the strength of the specimen in the presence and absence of the porosity P. B is a constant, whose value depends upon the morphology and the distribution of the pores in the specimen.

In the CCD tests presented, 0.3 mAh cm /C0 2 , which is equivalent to /C24 4.1 3 10 /C0 5 cm 3 of lithium, is cathodically deposited during each polarization period (Figure 8). The pore volume of LG-LPSCl and SG-LPSCl is V pore = 106.19 3 10 /C0 4 and 250.00 3 10 /C0 4 cm 3 , respectively. It is obvious that the pellet pore volume can well accommodate the amount of deposited lithium. FIB-SEM images (Figures 3D, 3E, 3H, 3I, and 7) reveal a preferential interfacial concentration of pores in SG-LPSCl. The CCD data indicate that these uniformly propagating stress fields due to dendrites are well accommodated or relaxed immediately in the vicinity of the stress generation sites, i.e., at the interface with a significant reduction in stress concentration, as pores represent blunt ends (Equation 2 and Figure 9B). 70,72,73 On the contrary, dendrite has to grow deeper into the bulk before it can encounter a pore. 56,66 In addition, in SG-LPSCL, extensive branching statistically opens up multiple channels of energy dissipation via interconnected pores and crack-surface interactions. Their stochastic topological distribution, i.e., the parameter B in Equation 9, further contributes to a stabilization via the opening of other modes viz. mode II/III (the crack surface is loaded in shear). This crack-pore interaction opens up a path for stress and energy dissipation and is referred to as the crack bridging mechanism. 56,57 Clearly, LG-LPSCl lacks such a microstructural advantage. 56,66 Hence, the existence of the porosity together with its preferential location, i.e., at the interface, tends to stabilize internally generated stresses.

These internal stress dissipation and shielding mechanisms, i.e., crack bridging and deflection, would result in further resistance in dendrite growth or equivalently crack growth. This is referred to as a ''crack-growth resistance curve'' or '' R curve'' (stable crack growth). Therefore, dendrite growth through bulk SG-LPSCl would result in '' R curve behavior'' for SG-LPSCl (Figure 10A), 58,66 as K IC is also a property

(A) Proposed crack and dendrite growth resistance ( R curve) behavior in SG-LPSCl due to internal stress-shielding mechanisms, i.e., crack deflection, bridging pathways, and homogeneous elastic anisotropy; a function of microstructural properties. The K I curve for LG-LPSCl is according to Equation 4, indicating unstable crack growth. The parameter a0 is the initial crack length, which is equivalent to surface roughness. ''Stationary'' refers to a non-propagating interfacial flaw/crack of length a0 introduced during cell fabrication, whereas '' D crack length'' refers to the increase in its length due to dendrite growth.

(B) The current density in CCD tests is equivalent to a volume strain rate. The data are extracted from the CCD tests of symmetricLi ǀ SG/LG-LPSCl ǀ Li cells that were fabricated at an isostatic stress of 265 MPa. Each point corresponds to 4.1 3 10 /C0 5 cm 3 of lithium deposition, pertaining to a volume strain of 0.09% and 0.10% for SG-LPSCl and LG-LPSCl, respectively. The higher pellet density of LGLPSCl leads to larger strain rates (10.4% higher) at the same current density compared with SGLPSCl, as evident from the slope of the respective plots. ''Safe'' and ''short-circuiting'' zones refer to CCD thresholds as obtained from Figure 8.

that depends on the microstructure. A constant K I for LG-LPSCl indicates an unstable crack growth right from the beginning of the dendrite growth (Figure 10A).

In the present scenario, the current density is equivalent to a strain rate, \_ ε (Figure 10B), as the bulk microstructure of SG/LG-LPSCl needs to adjust to the dendrite growth and allow for electrochemical lithium deposition. Thus, the volume of deposited lithium must cause equivalent volume change in the SEs. Since 0.3 mAh cm /C0 2 ( /C24 4.1 3 10 /C0 5 cm 3 ) of lithium is cathodically deposited during each polarization period, this corresponds-as a first approximation-to a total volume strain of /C24 0.028% and /C24 0.031% for SG-LPSCl and LG-LPSCl, respectively (Figure 10B). Volume strain is defined as D V Li / V , where D V Li is the volume of the lithium deposited during each polarization period, and V is the volume of the pellet enclosed between Ø = 6 mm lithium electrodes. In our simplistic approach, backflow of lithium is ignored. However, in reality, the strain in SG-LPSCl will further be lowered by two factors: (1) the electrodeposited lithium would predominantly fill into the pores located at the interface without causing significant strain and (2) at any given current density, the backflow of lithium will be higher due to uniform stress at Li ǀ SG-LPSCl. Consequently, the volume strain rate ( \_ ε = D V Li / V 3 1/ t ) in LG-LPSCl at any current density is /C24 10% higher than that in SG-LPSCl due to its higher density ( /C24 83% for SG-LPSCl, /C24 92% for LG-LPSCl). Since the strain rate dictates the way energy is released, the above-mentioned factors would aid the mechanical endurance of SG-LPSCl by significantly lowering the initial strain rate (Figures 8D-8F).

The degree of elastic anisotropy plays an important role in microstress dissipation. At the mesoscale, the presence of a higher density of grains, together with their much more random distribution in SG-LPSCl that manifests in variations in size, shape, and crystallite orientation, leads to an isotropic effective elastic constant

compared with LG-LPSCl. Therefore, the microstress propagates uniformly or is uniformly distributed in bulk SG-LPSCl (Figure 9C). 19,20

Interfacial roughness, bulk microscopic properties, surface, and volume defect population, as well as elastic anisotropy, are critical parameters governing the performance of lithium interfaces toward SEs. For LPSCl, we demonstrated that interfacial roughness and bulk microscopic properties are correlated and can be simultaneously engineered via grain size control. Large grains of LPSCl result in high interfacial roughness and low porosity, whereas the opposite holds for smaller grains. Systems with a larger statistical distribution of surface flaws, i.e., a high surface roughness, a high surface defect, and a low volume defect concentration, fail drastically in CCD tests. In contrast, systems with a lower number of interfacial defects and a comparatively high-volume defect concentration have greater mechanical endurance. Also, the preferential location of balanced volume defects is a crucial parameter in determining stress mitigation. Microscopically, the bulk of SG-LPSCl is statistically more random and mechanically more isotropic. Grain size engineering gives control over the grain boundary density and the TJ density as well as over the randomness of the internal microstructure. Since ceramics are probabilistic solids, grain size engineering provides control over and narrows down the range of the fracture toughness K IC as illustratively demonstrated by the CCD tests. And last, LPSCl forms a kinetically stable, self-limiting interphase with Li of a thickness of approximately 250 nm. 74 Within the length scales considered here (in micrometers), the general mechanism of dendrite growth as discussed above will still hold true.
