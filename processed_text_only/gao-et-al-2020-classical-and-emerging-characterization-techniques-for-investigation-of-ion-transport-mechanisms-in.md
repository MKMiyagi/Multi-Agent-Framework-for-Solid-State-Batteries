ABSTRACT: Ion transport in crystalline fast ionic conductors is a complex physical phenomenon. Certain ionic species (e.g., Ag + , Cu + , Li + , F -, O 2 -, H + ) in a solid crystalline framework can move as fast as in liquids. This property, although only observed in a limited number of materials, is a key enabler for a broad range of technologies, including batteries, fuel cells, and sensors. However, the mechanisms of ion transport in the crystal lattice of fast ionic conductors are still not fully understood despite the substantial progress achieved in the last 40 years, partly because of the wide range of length and time scales involved in the complex migration processes of ions in solids. Without a comprehensive understanding of these ion transport mechanisms, the rational design of new fast ionic conductors is not possible. In this review, we cover classical and emerging characterization techniques (both experimental and computational) that can be used to investigate ion transport processes in bulk crystalline inorganic materials which exhibit predominant ion conduction (i.e., negligible electronic conductivity) with a primary focus on literature published after 2000 and critically assess their

strengths and limitations. Together with an overview of recent understanding, we highlight the need for a combined experimental and computational approach to study ion transport in solids of desired time and length scales and for precise measurements of physical parameters related to ion transport.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

Fast ionic conductors are conventionally de /uniFB01 ned as materials, at solid state, which exhibit ionic conductivity comparable to or even higher than that in liquid state (usually for aqueous solution). This property makes fast ionic conductors appealing for several advanced technologies, including solid-state batteries, fuel cells, and gas sensors. 1 -3 The discovery of lithium fast ionic conductors with conductivity higher than 10 mS cm -1 at room temperature has led to the development of solid-state batteries with improved rate capability (i.e., less time required to charge the battery) compared with that of conventional liquidelectrolyte-based lithium-ion batteries. 3 With improved ion transport properties, oxide-ion and proton conductors promote the realization of solid-state fuel cells with diversi /uniFB01 ed chemical fuels without the need for noble metal catalysts compared with the fuel cells based on polymer membranes. 2 Compared with liquids, fast ionic conductors are safer choices as they are not /uniFB02 ammable or corrosive. In addition, fast ionic conductors can operate in a wider temperature range with greater selectivity than their liquid counterparts. 4 -10

However, fast ionic conductors in working solid-state devices need to simultaneously satisfy a wide array of desired attributes, including high ionic conductivity, good chemical, mechanical, and thermal stability, good processability, high selectivity, and low cost. These requirements substantially narrow down the list of candidates that can be applied in real devices. For oxide-ion and proton conductors used in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), to achieve the considerable ionic conductivity required for practical application, the operating temperature of SOFCs usually is as high as 700 ° C, which raises the manufacturing cost and demands extra energy input. Similarly, in the rapidly evolving /uniFB01 eld of solid-state batteries, no solid-state electrolytes employing fast lithium ionic conductors can yet satisfy all the required attributes. 11

To date, fast ionic conductors with various mobile ionic species, including but not limited to Li + , Na + , H + , Ag + , Cu + , F -, O 2 -, and H -, have been discovered and summarized in recent reviews. 4,10 -15 We note that both monovalent and multivalent ions, such as O 2 -and Mg 2+ , can be highly mobile in solids, with some of the recently discovered Mg-ion conductors exhibiting ionic conductivity as high as 0.1 mS cm -1 at room temperature. 7 Among all the ionic conductors, Li- and Na-ion conductors and proton and oxide-ion conductors have been the most heavily investigated since 2000, primarily because of their technological importance in batteries and fuel cells, respectively (Figure 1).

To facilitate comparison, the ionic conductivities of the best performing ionic conductors are summarized in Table 1. We note that conductivity is not simply correlated to ionic radii or charge per ionic radii, as classical electrostatic interaction

suggests. For instance, superionic conductivity at room temperature is usually observed for lithium- and sodium-ion conductors but not for proton conductors. The structure type also di /uniFB00 ers for the best performing ionic conductors of di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 using species. Overall, these observations suggest that ion transport in solids is a complex process, which may vary across di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 using species.

A comprehensive understanding of fast ionic conduction in crystalline solids can lead to generalized design rules for improved fast ionic conductors, but this understanding is challenging to attain. The classical picture of ion transport in crystalline solids is that ions jump between di /uniFB00 erent crystallographic sites, either one-by-one or collectively. Each jump with a distance of a few angstroms is associated with an activation barrier that is determined by the energy landscape created by the arrangement of atoms in the crystalline solid. This activation barrier directly a /uniFB00 ects the attempt frequency of ions (usually on the order of THz to MHz) and the successful jump frequencies that will result in macroscopic ion transport. However, the real picture of ion transport in solids is in fact far more complex. First, crystallographic disorder and local distortion are often present in crystalline solids at /uniFB01 nite temperatures. Therefore, ion transport is a /uniFB00 ected not only by the long-range bulk structure (e.g., tetragonal vs cubic garnet) but also by the structural features at local (angstroms) and intermediate (tens of angstroms) ranges. For instance, lithium transport in Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) is a /uniFB00 ected by speci /uniFB01 c local con /uniFB01 gurations of Ge and P (Ge/P shares the same crystallographic site), where the activation barriers for lithium transport range from 60 to 420 meV depending on how Ge and P atoms arrange locally. 23 Local distortion (e.g., octahedral tilting in a perovskite) can also strongly a /uniFB00 ect the ionic transport process. 24 Indeed, recent computational works indicate that fast ionic conduction is linked with local geometric frustration of the Li sublattice. 25 -28 Second, ion transport in crystalline solids is a dynamic process that spans a wide range of time scales. Starting from the vibration of atoms (ps) to ion jumps between di /uniFB00 erent crystallographic sites (ps to ms), the time scale of microscopic ion transport events can cross several orders of magnitude. Finally, ion transport in solids is coupled with phonons and can be coupled with electrons (or holes). 29 -34 All these factors add additional complexity when considering ion transport processes in crystalline solids.

The di /uniFB03 culties in understanding ion transport in crystalline solids and in further correlating the structures with ion transport properties are primarily 2-fold. First, defects and disorders in the crystalline structure are di /uniFB03 cult to characterize. When classical crystallography based on perfect periodicity is inadequate, tools and theories are needed to understand both the local and average structure of crystalline solids. This is particularly relevant for fast ionic conductors, as a majority of these conductors are rich in defects and disorder. Without understanding these defects and disorder in detail, correlation can hardly be made between structural and ion transport properties. Second, the development of a comprehensive physical picture of ion transport is di /uniFB03 cult. Ion transport crosses a wide range of time scales and involves structural relaxation at a wide range of length scales. Although most of these time and length scales can be probed today by the rapidly developing experimental and computational techniques, it remains challenging to capture the ion transport events occurring at certain time and length scales.

In Figure 2, we summarize the time and length scales accessible by existing experimental techniques. Although ion motion from 0.1 Hz (or 10 s) to 100 THz (or 10 -14 s) can be probed, no single technique can fully cover the ion transport processes at a broad range of time scale. 35 Similarly, it is impossible to capture structural features at various length scales using one single technique.

Inconsistencies also exist in literature which further complicates the understanding of ion transport mechanisms. For instance, di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients can be estimated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, tracer di /uniFB00 usion measurements, conventional relaxometry measurements, and pulsed /uniFB01 eld gradient nuclear magnetic resonance (PFG NMR) measurements, to name a few approaches. However, even for the same material, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients measured with di /uniFB00 erent techniques can still be drastically di /uniFB00 erent. In the lithium-ion conductor Li 10GeP2S12, di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 usion coef/uniFB01 cients were obtained with di /uniFB00 erent techniques: 2.2 × 10 -12 m 2

s -1 using PFG NMR, 1.3 × 10 -8 m 2 s -1 using NMR relaxometry, 36 and 1.4 × 10 -11 m 2 s -1 from ab initio MD simulation. 37 -39 A comprehensive understanding of the physics behind each probing technique and the physical meaning behind each measured di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient is therefore needed. Besides, aided by large databases of well-computed properties of materials and high throughput methods of computing iontransport-related properties, 40,41 ' stable ' superionic conductors can be theoretically predicted. However, to better guide the experimental e /uniFB00 orts of syntheses, it is important to consider the limitations and assumptions of computational techniques used to assess stability and the di /uniFB00 erences between di /uniFB00 erent evaluation methods.

In this review, we critically assess the capabilities of existing and emerging characterization techniques that can be used to probe ion transport in solids, with a particular focus on recent advances reported after 2000. In the last two decades, structural information on a wide range of time and length scales has become accessible, and unprecedented details regarding disorder and local distortions in solids have been unraveled. By reviewing these activities, we hope to provide the community with a present-day picture of the available tools and the missing ' Legos ' to understand ion transport processes in solids. We focus on crystalline inorganic materials which exhibit predominant ion conduction with negligible electronic conductivity in this review because these materials are ideal model systems to reveal the fundamental correlation between structure and ion transport processes. In this regard, glass, amorphous, and polymeric materials that lack long-range order are much more challenging to characterize and are beyond the scope of this review.

The review is structured as follows. We /uniFB01 rst brie /uniFB02 y overview ion transport mechanisms and the physical parameters related to ion transport. Then we discuss the relation between these physical parameters in the ion transport process. This discussion is followed by case studies of classical techniques, both

experimental and computational, investigating ion transport processes in crystalline inorganic solids, with a particular focus on how the related physical parameters can be measured and how these physical parameters are linked to ion transport mechanisms. With this information in mind, we further discuss the de /uniFB01 nitions and measurements of a few important yet seemingly confusing physical parameters relevant to ion transport (i.e., activation barrier, mobile ion concentration, and di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient) and screening criteria of stable superionic conductors from computation. In the discussion section, we summarize a few cases where di /uniFB00 erent techniques are combined to yield relatively complete pictures of ion transport processes. Current di /uniFB03 culties and emerging techniques for probing ion transport processes are highlighted at the end.

## 2. CLASSICAL UNDERSTANDING OF ION TRANSPORT MECHANISMS

## 2.1. Fundamental Physics

For di /uniFB00 erent types of ionic conductors and ion transport mechanisms, various theoretical models have been put forward to describe the ion transport processes. 42,43 In all these models, a commonset of physical parameters exists that are relevant to ion transport and are central to understanding the mechanisms of ion transport in solids. Below, we /uniFB01 rst discuss these physical parameters in the context of uncorrelated ion transport mechanisms, where the ion-hopping events show no correlation with each other with respect to time or space in the materials. Wethen extend the discussion to correlated ion transport, and a few speci /uniFB01 c ion transport models proposed in the literatures.

The classical model describing ion transport in solids treats ion hops as uncorrelated and independent, which is often the key mechanism at the limit of dilute mobile ions. 44 Atomic hopping in solids depends on point defects, such as vacancies or interstitials, with /uniFB01 xed lengths of individual jumps. The individual ion hops with no correlation can be described by a random-walk model. 45 The random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r , the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient under the theoretical framework of random walk, can be expressed as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Rn is the total displacement of a moving ion in n steps, t n is the duration to complete n steps of ion displacement, a is the hopping distance between two neighboring sites or free path, ν is the jump frequency of successful jumps, and b is a geometry factor of 2, 4, or 6 for one-, two-, or three-dimensional di /uniFB00 usion, respectively. Equation 1 is called the Einstein relation or the Einstein -Smoluchowski relation.

Comparing ion hopping to thermally activated Brownian motion, the jump frequency v can be further described by eq 2.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Here ν 0 is the attempt frequency, or the number of attempted jumps within unit time, and includes both successful jumps that can lead to macroscopic di /uniFB00 usion and unsuccessful ones. Δ G is the Gibbs free energy of activation, k B is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, Δ S is the activation entropy, and Δ H is the activation enthalpy (this is also called the activation energy or activation barrier and denoted E a ). Substituting ν in eq 1 with that in eq 2, we obtain

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The physical meaning of the activation enthalpy Δ H depends on the nature of defects. Intrinsic defects, including vacancies and self-interstitials, are thermally activated. Therefore, the activation energy of ion transport processes that involve such defects is the sum of the defect formation energy and migration energy. Extrinsic defects are usually introduced by doping. In general, the concentration of extrinsic defects far exceeds that of thermally activated intrinsic defects. The activation energy under such conditions can usually be approximated as the migration energy if there is no trapping between the mobile ion and dopants or other defects. 46,47 The ionic conductivity determined by extrinsic defects has been widely studied in lithium super ionic conductors (LISICONs), 48,49 sodium super ionic conductors (NASICONs), 50 and garnets. 51,52 Proton conduction in perovskite materials also arises from the generation of extrinsic defects upon water incorporation. 53 In complicated scenarios in which the interaction between defects (either intrinsic or extrinsic) and mobile ions is strong (e.g., in proton or oxide-ion conductors), an additional term of the defect trapping energy (similar to the defect formation energy) must be included. 46,54 -56

The random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r is de /uniFB01 ned from the microscopic picture of uncorrelated random ion jumps at the dilute concentration limit. D r can be related to the macroscopic long-range di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D σ through the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * , Haven ratio H R and correlation factor f . D σ is linked to the ionic conductivity σ through the Nernst -Einstein relation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where c is the mobile ion concentration and q is the charge of mobile ion. From eq 4, which describes a macroscopically observable quantity (i.e., D σ or σ ), microscopic physical parameters (e.g., the jump distance and frequency) can be derived. We discuss the de /uniFB01 nitions of the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient, Haven ratio, and correlation factor, as well as their relationship to the random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r in the following paragraph.

The tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * is often used to describe ion transport at relatively large length scales. 57 The classical approach to measure the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient is to induce a radioactive tracer that is chemically identical to the mobile species investigated (e.g., deuterium in the case of proton conductors). By measuring the concentration depth pro /uniFB01 le within the material after the radioactive tracer is introduced for a certain time, D * can be obtained by /uniFB01 tting according to Fick ' s law. The correlation factor f is de /uniFB01 ned as the ratio between the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * and the random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r as f = D * / D r . 45,58 This correlation factor is also named as tracer correlation factor and corresponds to single-ion correlations. 59 The Haven ratio relates the long-range di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D σ to the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * of an ionic conductor as H R = D * / D σ , 60 and describes the strength of multiion correlations. Overall, = = σ D D f D f H I r r R . The factor f I here denotes the collective correlation factor, which measures the strength of distinct-ion correlation e /uniFB00 ects, analogous to vacancywind e /uniFB00 ects. 59,61 Wenote that the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D *

can be precisely determined for certain classes of ionic conductors but D σ cannot. D σ is a derived quantity and is not directly measured due to the ambiguity in the de /uniFB01 nition of c . The random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r can be determined by QENS if the proper model is applied, whereas for other techniques such as NMR, the calculation of D r needs the assumption that jump distance a is the distance between two atoms in the crystal structure. These assumptions also cause ambiguity in the evaluation of f and H R , posing a fundamental challenge to quantify various aspects of the ion transport processes for indepth understanding.

By substituting D r in eq 3 with = σ D D f H r R and combining the result with eq 4, the macroscopic ionic conductivity can be expressed with parameters associated with elementary jumps of an ionic conductor:

where the factor of 1 /6 results from the assumed 3D isotropic motion as in the random walk model (i.e., b = 6). In random and uncorrelated ion transport processes, where the correlation factor f and Haven ration H R are both 1, the above eq 5 can be simpli /uniFB01 ed as

Both the correlation factor f and Haven ratio H R serve as indicators of the correlated e /uniFB00 ect in ion transport processes. Correlated ion transport is a multiparticle di /uniFB00 usion phenomenon. Individual hops in this case are no longer independent but involve correlation e /uniFB00 ects (mobile ion -mobile ion, and/or mobile ion -skeleton) which deviate from random walks. For such processes, the correlation factor f and Haven ratio H R take nonunity values.

The correlation factor f usually takes a value between 0 and 1. 62 -67 Various factors including the mobile ion concentration, geometric structure, and di /uniFB00 usion mechanism can a /uniFB00 ect the correlation factor. Table 2 summarizes the values of the correlation factors derived by calculations for ion transport processes in di /uniFB00 erent systems, from which the dependence of the correlation factors on dimensionality, lattice type, and di /uniFB00 usion mechanism can be observed. Most of the results were obtained by matrix method and Monte Carlo method. We further take an extreme condition of the vacancy mechanism in a one-dimensional atom chain here as an example to illustrate the correlation factor (Figure 3). For a moving atom (or tracer, shown as the red circle in Figure 3) with Z neighboring sites, when the moving atom jumps to one of the neighboring sites ( 1 / Z probability), a vacancy -tracer exchange process is completed. For a 1D chain, Z equals to two. The new vacancy position hence allows for a reverse jump, canceling another forward one, leading to -( ) n 1 2 Z 1 e /uniFB00 ective jumps out of n . 66 As illustrated in Figure 3, the tracer atom can only jump to and from the two neighboring sites, resulting in a long-range tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient of zero and hence a correlation factor f = 0.

As for the Haven ration H R, a straightforward physical meaning of Haven ratio remains absent 45 except in certain models (e.g., uncorrelated vacancy, correlated interstitialcy). A /uniFB00 ected by various factors, H R takes values from 0 to 1 in most ionic conductors with negligible electronic conductivity but can

Various di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients have been discussed above, which is to some extent rather confusing. Here, we reiterate and outline the de /uniFB01 nitions and measurement techniques of di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients. The measurement techniques will also be discussed in detail in section 3 and section 4.3. In general, di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients can be categorized as microscopic or macroscopic. The microscopic di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients can be probed using microscopic techniques, such as variable-temperature NMR, NMR relaxometry, 2D NMR, μ + SR, and QENS. These di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients are random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients D r and can be described by the Einstein -Smoluchowski relationship (eq 1), which relates D r to the jump distance and residence time of an atom on a certain lattice position. Tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * is one of the macroscopic di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients that describes ion transport at relatively large length scales. D * is measured by detecting isotopic tracers, hence the name, which is usually probed using tracer di /uniFB00 usion or the pulsed /uniFB01 eld gradient NMR technique. The long-range di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D σ is another macroscopic di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy that relates ionic conductivity with di /uniFB00 usivity by the Nernst -Einstein eq (eq 4).

Below, we discuss a few speci /uniFB01 c correlated ion transport models. These ion transport processes are very complex, and as a result, most have not been quantitatively analyzed under the context of eq 5. However, we note that some of the correlated

ion transport mechanisms can still be described by mean square displacement (MSD) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (section 4.3).

2.1.1. Jump Relaxation Model. Correlated forward -backward hopping is a feature that is evident in correlated ion transport processes. A physical explanation was provided in the jump relaxation model, which accounts for the interactions among the mobile ions (i.e., the Coulomb-cage e /uniFB00 ect) and between the mobile and immobile ions (i.e., periodic lattice potential). 81 In a crystalline solid electrolyte, mobile ions experience a repulsion interaction because of neighboring samecharge mobile ions, which changes during ion migration. The average charge of these surrounding mobile ions is approxi- where b denotes the dimensionality factor, N represents the number of mobile ions, and M represents the total number of steps that the mobile ions traveled. The total displacement ⟨ Rn 2 ⟩ as shown in eq 1 is replaced by an averaged sum (by 2 N ) of total displacement of N mobile ions in M steps. Besides, tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * , ionic conductivity σ , long-range di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D σ , correlation factor f , Haven ratio H R , and collective correlation factor f I can all be computed using MD. 59,80

mated as a cloud of ions, and the moving ion under consideration is viewed as being situated in a Coulomb cage produced by the ion cloud (Figure 4a). The Coulomb-cage e /uniFB00 ect generates a local potential minimum for each mobile ion such that each moving ion is far enough from the others, producing a set of equilibrium positions in space. Another crucial interaction is between mobile and immobile ions. Because of the periodicity of a crystal, the interaction potential for such an interaction is also periodic in space. Superposition of the local Coulomb-cage-e /uniFB00 ect minimum and long-range periodic lattice potential thus yields the overall potential well experienced by the moving ion (Figure 4b). When ion migration occurs, e.g., the ion jumps from lattice site A to B (Figure 4b), the local potential minimum for each moving ion as resulting from the Coulomb-cage e /uniFB00 ect is perturbed while the periodic lattice potential superimposed on the moving ion remains approximately unaltered. This drives the system away from equilibrium. Thus, a structural relaxation process must occur such that the equilibrium is restored. Two competing relaxation processes are possible (Figure 4b). First, as a many-particle route, when the ion hops to site B, the ion cloud also moves forward, establishing a new local Coulomb-cage-e /uniFB00 ect minimum and resulting in a new equilibrium and a net ionic current. Second, as a single-particle route, the ion may also hop back to A from B, restoring the equilibrium with no detectable ionic current. A comparison is shown in the lower part of Figure 4c. Hopping forward, the mobile ion must overcome an energy barrier of δ B → C( t ) as denoted in Figure 4c. Hopping back, the

energy barrier is δ B → A ( t ), which is much smaller than δ B → C( t ), as determined by the overall energy landscape. Consequently, there is usually a strong preference for backward hopping in correlated ion transport processes, which could be the origin of the smaller-than-one correlation factors f for such processes. In other words, as explained by the jump relaxation model, because of correlation e /uniFB00 ects, not all elementary hops contribute to macroscopic long-range ion migration.

Through the basic assumptions of the jump relaxation model, one can relate ion transport processes to the dielectric spectra (or conductivity spectra) of a material, although inconsistencies exist between theoretical modeling and experiments in particular at extreme long-time or low-frequency. Later, to improve the accuracy of theoretical models, the jump relaxation model was re /uniFB01 ned with the proposed concepts of mismatch and relaxation (CMR) 82 and mismatch generated relaxation for the accommodation and transport of ions (MIGRATION). 83,84 In the re /uniFB01 ned model, the relaxation rates of single- and many-particle routes are assumed to be proportional to each other throughout the ion migration process, both decaying exponentially with time. In addition, the ion cloud constituted by the nearest neighbors is assumed to always exert an electrostatic repulsion on the mobile ion. This model has achieved great success in describing ion transport processes in glassy and disordered crystalline materials. However, the Haven ratio is taken as unity in such models, which require future improvement.

2.1.2. Concerted Migration. Concerted migration, 85 -89 interstitialcy, 90 -94 and ' knock-o /uniFB00 ' (also called ' knockon ' ) 23,95,96 mechanisms are similar in nature, where two or more mobile ions simultaneously jump to occupied neighboring sites. The interstitialcy mechanism has been mostly reported for oxide-ion conductors. A similar mechanism was also proposed for Li-ion conductors, although with di /uniFB00 erent nomenclatures such as ' knock-o /uniFB00 ' , ' knock-on ' , or ' kick-out ' mechanism. Similar to the jump relaxation model, electrostatic repulsion between the migrating and neighboring mobile ions is considered, which triggers simultaneous and continuous jumping of multiple ions. 23,90,96 -104 Schematic illustrations of the interstitialcy and ' knock-o /uniFB00 ' mechanisms are provided in parts a and b of Figure 5, respectively. 90 On the basis of MD simulations, the lowest-energy di /uniFB00 usion pathway in the oxideion conductor La2CoO4+ δ was revealed to be A -B -C, in which interstitial O atoms (A) hop toward occupied sites B and ' knock-o /uniFB00 ' the B-site O atom, which jumps to the next interstitial site C. For concerted migration, Coulomb interaction among mobile ions can lead to lower migration barriers than those of independent, uncorrelated hops. 37,80,87 The concerted migration barrier, caused by the e /uniFB00 ect of Coulombic repulsion, has been quanti /uniFB01 ed by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations in Li-ion conductor Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS), cubic Li7La3Zr2O12 ( c -LLZO), and Li1.3Al0.3 Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP). 80 When the Li concentration is high, a fraction of Li ions must occupy the crystallographic sites that have higher energies in addition to other lithium ions at low-energy sites and can be equilibrated at these high-energy sites, as a result of strong Coulomb repulsion from other Li ions. 80 In macroscopic ion transport, the migration of lithium ions at high- and low-energy sites is synchronized. In such a concerted migration of multiple ions, lithium ions at high-energy sites would move downhill in the energy landscape and partially cancel out the required energy

for lithium ions at low-energy sites climbing uphill, resulting in low-barrier concerted migration, 80 as illustrated in Figure 5c.

2.1.3. Ion Migration Facilitated by Polyanion Reorientation. The jump relaxation model treats the structural lattice as mobile and immobile ions. However, immobile ions without translational motion can still have degrees of freedom for rotation, which correlates with the migration of moving ions. We thus discuss anion reorientation and its correlation with ion transport in this section. The paddle wheel e /uniFB00 ect was /uniFB01 rst proposed by Kvist. et al. 105 for Li2SO4, followed by works on substituted Na3PO4, i.e., Na3PO4 -Na2SO4 solid solution, 43 antiperovskite variants (NO2)ONa3, 43 closo-borate, and others. 106 -113 The migration barrier for sodium is lowered by the rotation of SO 4 tetrahedra, which propels sodium ions, as illustrated in Figure 6a. 106 Such a mechanism is commonly observed in plastic and rotator phases, i.e., orientationally disordered phases (ODPs). Polyanions contributing to this mechanism include nitrites, nitrates, carbonates, (hydro)sulfates, and (hydro)phosphates. 114 -116 The revolving door mechanism is similar to the paddle wheel mechanism involving both anionic groups and cations; however, instead of being propelled by anion reorientation, cation movement is suggested to induce anion reorientation. 117 Anion reorientation has also been reported in metal borohydrides, alkali tri /uniFB02 uoromethanesulfonates MCF3SO3 (M = Li, Na), 118 and antiperovskite ionic conductor with complex anions. 9,119 Most metal borohydrides with BH4 -, B10H10 2 -, B12H12 2 -, CB9H10 -, and CB11H12 -groups undergo anion reorientation processes. 120 -130 A schematic illustration of the anion reorientation mechanism is provided in the work of Lu et al., 128 reproduced in Figure 7. The correlation between Li + /Na + cation hopping and borohydride anion rotation is indicated by the simultaneous increase of the proton

spin -lattice relaxation rate and decrease of the 7 Li NMR line width with varying temperatures.

In ion conductors of anions (such as oxide-ion conductors), anion migration can also be coupled with the rotation of polyanions. The cog-wheel mechanism is described as processes of dynamic orientational correlations, in which the bonding environments of the polyanions are dynamically switching between two related con /uniFB01 gurations (e.g., GaO 4 and O3Ga-OGaO3) during ion transport. 131 -133 From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, oxygen migration within the La1 -x Ba1+ x GaO4 -x /2 crystal structure was shown to proceed by reorientation of polyanion groups (GaO 4 ) and the exchange of oxygen atoms, i.e., breaking and reforming of Ga 2 O7 units. 133 A similar mechanism was also proposed in oxygen conductors Bi 1 -x Sr x VO4 -0.5 x , 134 Bi 1 -x V x O1.5+ x , 135,136 and Bi26Mo10O69, 137 in which anion groups all undergo breaking, rotation, and reformation to facilitate oxygen transport in the structures. A schematic illustration of ion transport mechanism of Bi26Mo10O69 is presented in Figure 6c.

In most cases discussed above, ion migration and anion reorientation are observed to occur simultaneously. However, questions still remain as to whether ion migration and anion reorientation are casually related, and if yes, whether ion migration causes anion reorientation or whether the reverse is true.

2.1.4. Phonon-E /uniFB00 ect Migration. In addition to cation -cation repulsion and anion-reorientation-facilitated ion migration, low-energy phonon mode (or lattice vibration) was also considered to trigger ion migration. In the Brownmillerite structure of oxide-ion conductor SrFeO2.5 with a 1D oxygen vacancy channel along [110], oxygen di /uniFB00 usion proceeds with the help of a ' zigzag to zagzig ' phonon con /uniFB01 guration switch at the picosecond scale between the T1 and T2 con /uniFB01 gurations, as illustrated in Figure 8. 138 The T1 and T2 con /uniFB01 gurations are indicated in the T 3 con /uniFB01 guration as gray- and black-bordered triangles, respectively. With certain switching frequency, the T 1 and T2 con /uniFB01 gurations exchange constantly, behaving like a ' gate ' in the 1D di /uniFB00 usion channel of oxygen, as described by the

Speci /uniFB01 c low-energy (7 meV) lattice modes enables movement of apical oxygen atoms of FeO6 octahedra, which is proposed based on inelastic neutron scattering (INS) results along with DFT computations. This mechanism enables the use of new approaches for designing e /uniFB03 cient oxide-ion conductors, observed in other Ruddlesden-Popper-type oxide-ion conductors, e.g., Nd2NiO4+ δ , 139 La2CuO4+ δ . 140 A more complicated ion transport mechanism was revealed by Chroneos et al. for La2NiO4+ δ 92 and by Li et al. 141 for Ln2NiO4+ δ , where phonon modes and the interstitialcy mechanism were observed to be coupled to assist oxygen transport, based on phonon mode softness obtained by frozen phonons and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and di /uniFB00 usion paths revealed by the climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.

## 2.2. Structural Factors Relevant to Ion Transport

According to eq 5, mobile ion concentration c , mobile ion charge q , jump distance a , jump frequency ν 0 , temperature T , correlation factor f , Haven ratio H R , migration entropy Δ S , and activation energy Δ H can all a /uniFB00 ect the ionic conductivity. Here, we extend our discussion to structural factors that a /uniFB00 ect these parameters and hence a /uniFB00 ect the ionic conductivity. A schematic illustration showing relationships among these structural factors, ion-transport-related physical parameters is presented in Figure 9. Ion correlations (i.e., f and H R ) were not

Figure 9. Relationships among the ionic conductivity and structure factors and ion-transport-related physical parameters. All parameters in /uniFB01 gure can a /uniFB00 ect ionic conductivity in di /uniFB00 erent ways. Parameters in the outermost circle are structural factors, such as bottleneck, lattice volume, lattice dynamics, local disorder, local distortion, defect, and coordination, which in /uniFB02 uence the parameter within the same sector and then a /uniFB00 ect the ionic conductivity. Parameters directly a /uniFB00 ect the ionic conductivity are shown in the inner circle with black border, including activation energy, jump distance, mobile ion concentration, attempt frequency, and entropy.

included in the /uniFB01 gure because the impact of structural parameters on ion correlations is not clear, although ion correlations certainly a /uniFB00 ect ionic conductivity. We /uniFB01 rst note that the physical parameters relevant to ion transport are mainly a /uniFB00 ected by the lattice volume, bottleneck size for ion transport, coordination, local disorder, local distortion, defects, and lattice dynamics. 142 Second, several of these structural factors (e.g., the lattice volume) a /uniFB00 ect multiple physical parameters relevant to ion transport and further a /uniFB00 ect ionic conductivity in a very complex way. Each structural factor and its e /uniFB00 ect on iontransport-relevant physical parameters are discussed as follows.

2.2.1. Lattice Volume and Bottleneck. For solid-state ionic conductors, ions always move through empty space. In principle, for the same structure, a larger lattice volume means larger empty space in the crystal structure, which presumably

results in a reduced activation barrier and increased jump distance, thus favoring facile ion transport. 13 In practice, however, this may not always be the case. For example, lattice volume also a /uniFB00 ect the site energy of the ions 142 -146 and a /uniFB00 ect the potential energy surface in the crystal structures in a complex way.

The lattice volume can be tuned through either mechanical strain or chemical substitution. Mechanical strain, being either tensile or compressive, can be used to study the e /uniFB00 ect of lattice volume on ion transport or to tune the ionic conductivity. 147 -152 AIMD simulation of LGPS 153 demonstrated that isotropically compressing the crystal structure (smaller lattice volume) leads to a greatly increased activation barrier and decreased ionic conductivity. In addition to the activation barrier, mechanical strain can also alter the attempt frequency of moving ions. For example, the Ce -Ostretching modes for the proton conductor BaCe0.8 Y0.2O3 -δ was observed to become harder with increasing pressure, 154 which directly a /uniFB00 ects the activation barrier and attempt frequency. Chemical substitution is another approach that is extensively used to change the lattice volume. 155 -157 However, chemical substitution simultaneously introduces changes to the chemical environment, such as local defect, coordination, energy landscape, and site disordering. Therefore, chemical substitution is not suggested as a clear-cut method to study the correlation between lattice volume and ion transport properties.

The bottleneck size of a structure very often scales with the lattice volume and thus can a /uniFB00 ect the ion transport process in a similar way as the lattice volume. 13,158 However, exceptions do exist. For Li10MP2S12 (M = Ge, Sn), when changing Ge 4+ to Sn 4+ , the lattice volume increases because of the larger ionic size of Sn 4+ , but the bottleneck along the c -axis is tightened due to the weak interaction between Sn 4+ and S 2 -, thus hindering the Li ionic transport. 33

2.2.2. Coordination. The coordination environments of ions moving along the migration path primarily a /uniFB00 ect the activation barrier of ion transport but can also a /uniFB00 ect the jump distance. Previous computational works 144,145 suggest that the migration energy of ions in the crystalline lattices can be rationalized by the changes of anion coordination environment along the migration path. The ion migration energy of lithium ion in spinel is larger than in olivine and layered structures because lithium occupies tetrahedral site in spinels (preferred coordination for Li + ), while lithium ions in the other two structures are six-coordinated. Similar phenomenon was also observed in divalent ionic conductors. In spinels, the migration energy of Zn 2+ is larger than those of Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ because Zn 2+ prefers tetrahedral coordination but Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ do not. In a recent work, high magnesium-ion mobility was experimentally observed in spinel MgSc2Se4, in which Mg atoms reside at the unfavorable tetrahedral sites but pass through an intermediate state with a more favorable octahedral coordination. This process leads to a smaller di /uniFB00 erence of the site energy between the start and intermediate states and thus /uniFB02 attening of the energy landscape along the migration path. 7

In addition, the anion lattice structure greatly a /uniFB00 ects cation transport. 143 Ion conductors with less densely packed bodycentered cubic (bcc) anion sublattice, in which lithium ions move directly from one tetrahedral site to another, generally have a low activation barrier and high ionic conductivity.

2.2.3. Local Disorder and Distortion. Most superionic conductors exhibit a wide range of local disorder in lattice and distortion in structures. The disordering can occur between cations and anions or mobile and immobile ions. Distortion generally means deviation of the bond distances and/or angles from the perfect symmetry and periodicity suggested by classical crystallography.

It is important to note that local disorder of mobile ion sublattice and distortion of the local crystal structure often appear together and are thus highly correlated. In a recently discovered lithium-ion conductor LiTi 2(PS4)3 (LTPS), Hautier et al. demonstrated that Li ions do not stay on well-de /uniFB01 ned crystallographic sites but rather sit in the locally distorted crystallographic space, leading to a frustrated energy landscape for fast Li-ion di /uniFB00 usion. 26 He et al. performed topological analyses on the crystal structures of all Li-containing oxides and sul /uniFB01 des and found such locally enlarged or distorted crystallography coexists with local Li-site disordering. 142 For the perovskite structure Li 3 x La2/3 -x □ 1/3 -2 x TiO3 ( □ refers to a vacancy), the lithium ion conductivity reaches a maximum at x = 0.1. 24 The maximized ionic conductivity at this composition is correlated to the arrangement of the cations (La 3+ and Li + ) and vacancies at A sites (Wycko /uniFB00 3 c ) and local distortions of the TaO6 octahedra caused by smaller lithium ions occupying the La 3+ site.

Many ionic conductors undergo an order -disorder superionic transition with sharply increased ionic conductivity and increased degree of disordering at high temperature. For example, the cubic lithium garnet (high-temperature phase) shows much higher ionic conductivity of 0.4 mS cm -1 at room temperature, compared with tetragonal garnet lithium conductors (low-temperature phase). This is attributed to the disordering of lithium in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites in the cubic structure, which are ordered in the tetragonal phase. 159 -161 The distortion of ZrO 6 octahedra is found to be correlated with the change of lithium occupancy from octahedral sites in the tetragonal phase to o /uniFB00 -centered octahedral sites in the cubic phase, which contributes to increased ionic conductivity. 159 Order -disorder phase transitions resulting in increased ionic conductivity were also observed in a number of sodium-ion and proton conductors. 122,125,162,163

In addition, the disordering of immobile cations or anions also greatly a /uniFB00 ects the mobile-ion migration. In lithium antiperovskites, locally interchanging one pair of Cl -O in disordered Li 3 OCl, i.e., swapping the A and B sites in the perovskite, leads to a distorted local structure and di /uniFB00 erent Li-ion migration barrier. As a result, a larger mean square displacement (MSD, see section 4.3) of lithium ions is observed compared with Li3OCl without O -Cl swapping. 164 In Li3OCl1 -x Br x antiperovskite lithium ion conductors, the activation barrier is sensitive to the arrangements of Cl and Br, of which the con /uniFB01 guration of a Cl-rich migration tunnel with Br-rich end points results in the lowest migration barrier among all investigated con /uniFB01 gurations. 165 In the oxide-ion conductor Na 0.5 Bi 0.5 TiO3 with a disordered A-site Na + /Bi 3+ cation sublattice, the local con /uniFB01 gurations of Na and Bi greatly a /uniFB00 ect the oxygen ion migration barriers, ranging from 0.22 eV to more than 2.0 eV for the pathways with local Bi -Bi coordination and Na -Na coordination, respectively. 79 Their AIMD simulations also predict that a completely ordered A-site Na + /Bi 3+ cation sublattice decreases the activation energy from 0.38 to 0.24 eV and increases oxygen-ion conductivity by 5-fold at 900 K, although the ordered A-site sublattice has a higher energy in this perovskite structure.

2.2.4. Defects. As previously discussed, defects in materials can be classi /uniFB01 ed as intrinsic or extrinsic, and the type of defect and their interactions can greatly a /uniFB00 ect the defect formation,

migration path of moving ions, and ion migration enthalpy. Point defects such as vacancies 166 and interstitials 167 are often directly related to ion transport in crystalline conductors, and ion transport mechanisms in uncorrelated hopping are classi /uniFB01 ed as vacancy or interstitial transport mechanisms, according to the type of defects present in the material. Di /uniFB00 erent defect types lead to di /uniFB00 erent jump distances. Defect formation enthalpy is crucial to ionic transport. We devoted a subsection to discuss defect formation in section 4.1.

In addition, defect concentration is a /uniFB00 ected by the defect type, resulting in di /uniFB00 erent mobile ion concentration, which has a great e /uniFB00 ect on the ionic conductivity and activation energy. However, it should be noted that the defect concentration and mobile ion concentration are not equal in many ion-conducting systems.

2.2.5. Lattice Dynamics. Lattice dynamics describe the atomic vibrations within a crystal structure. The vibration frequency of ions at the lattice sites lies in the THz range (approximately 10 12 -10 13 Hz). The pioneering work of Wakamura has revealed that low activation energies of Li, Na, Ag, and Cu ionic conductors are associated with low-energy optical phonon. 168 However, the e /uniFB00 ect of lattice dynamics on the ion transport behavior has been less explored than the other factors discussed above. In recent works, 29 -32,169 the correlation between lattice dynamics and ion transport has been investigated from the following perspectives, making an important leap forward. We present a brief overview below and a detailed discussion in section 3.2.4.

Ionic conductivity and other related transport characteristics were studied under the context of phonon density of states (pDOS). It has been suggested that lower lithium vibration frequency or lower lithium phonon band center is correlated to a lower activation energy of fast ionic conductors, 29 which can be used as a descriptor to screen new lithium ion conductors. 169 Ionic transport was also analyzed with respect to the polarizability of the lattice and its corresponding acoustic phonon properties. 138 -141 Speci /uniFB01 cally, it has been demonstrated that the polarizability of the host ion lattice a /uniFB00 ects the lattice vibration strength as well as the activation barrier and prefactor. 170 -172

## 3. EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES

In this section, we critically review existing experimental techniques used to study ion transport processes in crystalline inorganic materials. In section 3.1, techniques used to directly probe ion transport properties (e.g., activation barrier, di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient, and ionic conductivity) are /uniFB01 rst discussed. Then in section 3.2, we discuss structural probes (bulk and local structures and lattice dynamics), which are used to correlate structural factors with ion transport properties. Finally, in section 3.3, we compare the strengths and limitations of the di /uniFB00 erent experimental techniques. In each subsection, we show detailed examples with a primary focus on lithium, sodium, proton, and oxide-ion conductors, from which most of the reports were found after 2000 as indicated in Figure 1, but other types of ionic conductors are also covered.

## 3.1. Ion Transport

Ion transport in a crystal lattice involves multiple length scales which can be divided into microscopic and macroscopic levels. Macroscopic ion transport processes are produced via a series of microscopic ion transport events in di /uniFB00 erent time and length scales. Experimental techniques to probe microscopic and macroscopic ion transport processes are discussed below.

3.1.1. Microscopic Ion Transport. The nature of microscopic ion transport is the basis for understanding long-range ion transport processes. For various microscopic physical parameters that can be measured (e.g., the jump frequency, jump distance, random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r , and activation energy), we should be fully aware of the time scale to which the probing experimental techniques are sensitive. For instance, a technique that is sensitive to the jump process between crystallographic sites, which occurs on the order of microseconds or even slower, cannot be applied to study the vibration processes at the picosecond scale. Microscopic ion dynamics are commonly studied by nuclear magnetic resonance, quasi-elastic neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation. In the following, we will discuss how these techniques are used to study microscopic ion transport. In addition, we highlight the critical need for the use of complementary experimental techniques to study microscopic ion transport processes that cover a broad range of time scales.

3.1.1.1. Variable-Temperature Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has been proven to be a versatile tool to study ion dynamics and is sensitive to a broad range of time scales (10 -10 to 10 2 s). 57 The mobile ion (e.g., Li + ) can be directly probed by NMR 173 -175 and then jump frequency, jump distance, di /uniFB00 usion

coe /uniFB03 cient, di /uniFB00 usion path topology, activation energy, and correlation e /uniFB00 ects during ion transport can be evaluated, provided that ion transport events fall within the time scales of NMR spectroscopy.

The line shape analysis of variable-temperature NMR spectra can be used to study the ion jump frequency, random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient, and the associated activation barrier. At low temperature, the NMR central transition is broad and Gaussian-shaped, caused by various NMR interactions in solids, which is in stark contrast to the sharp lines observed in liquid NMRwhere rapid isotropic tumbling of molecules is present. At high temperature, as the ion jumps exceed the time scale of the relevant NMR interactions determined by the rigid-lattice line width, a sharp Lorentzian-shaped line with substantially reduced line width appears. This is re /uniFB02 ected in typical motional narrowing (MN) curve 176 (Figure 10a). At the onset temperature T onset of the ion motion, the jump frequency can be estimated by τ = -M 1 2rigid lattice . 177,178 The M 2rigid lattice is the second moment in the rigid lattice line and can be calculated based on the van Vleck expression 179 and is shown in eq 8: 180 -182

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where, γ i is the gyromagnetic ratios of atoms, h is Planck ' s constant, I and S are the nuclear spin of their nuclear, and r jk is distances between interacting nuclei. It can be clearly seen that the total second moment measured for the resonant spin I consists of the second moment derived from interactions with resonant spins and the total interactions of resonant spins I with di /uniFB00 erent nonresonant spins S , which means that the average local magnetic /uniFB01 eld felt by the resonance spin is the sum of the magnetic /uniFB01 elds generated by all the resonant and nonresonant nuclei. For example, the Li jump frequencies at T onset for Li 10 GeP2S12, Li 11 SiP2 S12 , and Li 10SnP2S12 calculated by eq 8 are 1.4 × 10 -4 s -1 at 125 K, 1.5 × 10 -4 s -1 at 145 K, and 1.5 × 10 -4 s -1 at 145 K, respectively. Another method to calculate ion jump frequency using MN curve is through τ -1 ≈ 2 π × δ rl s -1 , where δ rl is the line width of the rigid lattice. 183 Wenote that this obtained jump frequency corresponds to that at this speci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ection temperature T infle (Figure 10a), which di /uniFB00 ers at other temperatures. Moreover, the activation energy of the mobile ions can also be estimated using the empirical formula proposed by Waugh and Fedin, 184 E a(meV) ≈ 1.617 × T onset .

With the jump frequency in hand, one can further estimate the random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r based on eq 1, assuming threedimensional di /uniFB00 usion with geometry factor b as 6. Given these conditions, eq 1 can be rewritten as eq 9:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

here, a is the jump distance, which is generally considered as the distance between two sites, and τ is the jump time, i.e., the reciprocal of the jump frequency ν . We note that in NMR measurement, due to the absence of any chemical or electrical /uniFB01 eld gradient, ions move randomly in space without external driving force similar to the random walk model. Therefore, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient measured from these NMR techniques is the random walk di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r . Therefore, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient obtained in this way is microscopic in nature and can only provide information for a motion process at the time scale comparable to the relevant NMR interactions (e.g., the kHz -MHz scale for dipolar and quadrupolar interactions). In addition, the factor 1 /6 comes from the assumed 3D isotropic motion, which can di /uniFB00 er for correlated transport and motion processes with reduced dimensionality.

3.1.1.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Relaxometry. Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry (NMR relaxometry) is another important method to probe microscopic ion transport processes and is more accurate than the MN curve analysis. Two NMR relaxation processes are relevant here: longitudinal relaxation (spin -lattice relaxation, SLR) and transverse relaxation (spin -spin relaxation, SSR). These two relaxation processes are sensitive to ion transport processes at di /uniFB00 erent time scales. Two types of SLR rate are present: one is the SLR rate in the laboratory frame of reference (i.e., static), T 1 ; the other one is in the rotation frame of reference, T 1 ρ , in which the frame of reference rotates around the axis of the external magnetic /uniFB01 eld B 0 ( z -axis) with the Larmor frequency under the applied magnetic /uniFB01 eld B 1 .

T 1 is sensitive to ion motion of targeted nuclei close to the Larmor frequency ( ω 0 ), which is determined by ω 0 = γ B 0 ( γ is magnetogyric ratio). It mainly reveals the local fast motion with the jump frequency in the range of 10 7 -10 9 s -1 . T 1 ρ can be used to probe slower motion with a frequency of several tens of kHz under selected lock-in /uniFB01 elds B 1 ( ω 1 = γ B 1 ) or rotation frame of reference. 185 -188 The SSR rate ( T 2 ) is sensitive to even slower motion and the corresponding relaxation time is on the order of 10 -3 s or even slower. Therefore, motional processes at a broad range of time scales can be e /uniFB00 ectively probed using these three types of relaxation time measurements. The analysis of T 2 is very complex because T 2 is related to not only the high-frequency motion but also the low-frequency motion and various other factors during the measurement, such as magnetic /uniFB01 eld inhomogeneity. Therefore, T 1 and T 1 ρ analyses are often used in NMR relaxometry methods.

In SLR experiments, the SLR times, T 1 or T 1 ρ , are measured as a function of temperature, as shown in Figure 10b. The log(1/ T 1 ) (or log(1/ T 1 ρ )) vs 1/ T curves usually reach a maximum at a critical temperature, and the rate τ -1 of ion motion at this temperature can be obtained using ω 0 τ ≈ 1 (or ω 1 τ ≈ 0.5), where ω 0 and ω 1 are the Larmor frequency in the laboratory and rotation frame, respectively. These curves are usually symmetric for a 3D isotropic uncorrelated hopping process and exhibit asymmetry because of correlation e /uniFB00 ects or the reduced dimensionality of the ion transport process. 170,189 The correlation e /uniFB00 ects can be understood using Bloembergen -Purcell -Pound models (BPP models), 168 which account for the Coulombic interactions and structural disorder. The entire curve can be separated into a low-temperature /uniFB02 ank and a hightemperature /uniFB02 ank. In general, the low-temperature /uniFB02 ank contains information on local ion transport, whereas the hightemperature /uniFB02 ank is relevant to long-range ion di /uniFB00 usion. Analysis of the slopes of the high- and low-temperature /uniFB02 anks, activation barriers at di /uniFB00 erent length scales, and di /uniFB00 usion path topology at the relevant time scales can be obtained. Furthermore, by comparing the slopes of the low- and hightemperature /uniFB02 anks, β = E a,low/ E a,high can be obtained, revealing correlation e /uniFB00 ects of ion transport processes, e.g., in Li 6PS5Br, 190

3.1.1.3. Two-Dimensional Exchange NMR. Two-dimensional exchange NMR (2D NMR) makes it possible to observe ion jumps between di /uniFB00 erent crystallographic sites. 196,197 In a typical 2D exchange NMR measurement, the nuclei spins are /uniFB01 rst excited and allowed to ' talk ' with each other during a userde /uniFB01 ned mixing time. The interaction between di /uniFB00 erent nuclei spins is encoded in the free induction decay (FID) signal. Speci /uniFB01 cally speaking, the resonance frequency ω ( t ′ ) of a certain ion at time t ′ is correlated to the resonance frequency ω ( t ″ ) after a mixing time τ ( τ = t ″ -t ′ ). If there is no ion jump during the mixing time, ω ( t ′ ) = ω ( t ″ ), only signals along the diagonal intensities are observed. If a jump to another site occurs during the mixing time, then ω ( t ′ ) ≠ ω ( t ″ ), leading to o /uniFB00 -diagonal intensities. This o /uniFB00 -diagonal signal is directly related to the jump between two di /uniFB00 erent lattice sites, which can be observed in many structures, e.g., in Li-ion conductors Li 7 PSe6, 176 and Li2ZrO3 (Figure 11a,b). 198 According to simple /uniFB01 rst-order kinetics, the o /uniFB00 -diagonal signal intensities can be analyzed as a function of mixing time employing eq 10.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Here, I ij is the o /uniFB00 -diagonal signal intensity after the mixing and I 0 is the diagonal signal intensity before mixing, τ ij is the time for a jump from position i to j and τ m is the mixing time. Sometimes, although the o /uniFB00 -diagonal signal intensity cannot be observed, broadening of the diagonal intensity does appear. For garnet structure Li5La3Nb2O12, 196 upon increasing the mixing time from 200 ms to 1 s, no o /uniFB00 -diagonal intensity can be observed but broadening of the diagonal signal is noticeable (Figure 11c,d). This broadening of the diagonal signal suggests that at the time scale of 200 ms to 1 s, the jump in this material occurs between the octahedral sites not the tetrahedral sites. Because of technical limitations, the jump time τ can be probed in 2D exchange NMR is usually within 10 -4 to 1 s, similar to the time scale accessible from impedance measurements. Finally, we note that the NMR resolution is intrinsically low for ion conductors with fast ion motion and diamagnetic nature. Higher magnetic /uniFB01 eld, lower temperature, and the selection of a more appropriate probing isotope (e.g., 6 Li vs 7 Li) are all crucial for a successful 2D exchange NMR measurement.

3.1.1.4. Quasi-Elastic Neutron Scattering. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) probes ion di /uniFB00 usion and rotation processes on the atomic scale, although a large amount of samples (typically ∼ 10 g) is often required. 199 Neutrons can interact with atomic nuclei via elastic and inelastic scattering. For pure elastic scattering, the energy transfer between source neutrons and the sample is equal to 0, whereas inelastic scattering involves relatively large energy transfer. When the interaction between neutrons and the sample occurs with small energy transfer near 0 (usually ± 2 meV), such interaction is called quasi-elastic scattering, as illustrated in Figure 12a. 199 In QENS measurements, the intensity of scattered neutrons is measured as a function of momentum transfer Q and energy transfer ω , plotted as the scattering function S ( Q , ω ). The /uniFB01 nite resolution of the instrument is measured as the peak width of the elastic scattering function. The broadening of a quasi-elastic scattering function is indicative of ion di /uniFB00 usion in materials, as illustrated in Figure 12b for the Li-ion conductor 7 Li 7 P3S11 crystal 200 at elevated temperatures. QENS is sensitive to motion processes at the time scale of 10 -8 to 10 -12 s. 201 From QENS measurements, parameters related to ion dynamics at the atomic scale, such as the ion jump distance, jump frequency, and random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r , can be obtained. 201,202

Neutron scattering can be either coherent or incoherent depending on whether the scattered neutron waves from di /uniFB00 erent scattering centers interfere with each other. Coherent scattering refers to the case when interference occurs between scattered neutrons from di /uniFB00 erent atoms, from which the information on crystal structure can be resolved, such as in neutron di /uniFB00 raction; incoherent scattering means no interference between scattered neutrons, therefore, single-atom motion can be investigated. The strength of neutron coherent and incoherent scattering for elements are quanti /uniFB01 ed by their scattering lengths b (shown in Table 3 for selected elements)

a Cells left in blank are not reported in ref 211, and in general very small; their incoherent cross sections are less than 1 × 10 -28 m 2 . b Because of the large neutron absorption of 6 Li, 7 Li is more suitable for QENS measurement of lithium conductors. For other elements that the isotope is not speci /uniFB01 ed, their scattering lengths are weightedaverage of the respective isotopes and cross sections σ s , where σ π = ⟨| |⟩ b 4 s 2 . Because the incoherent neutron scattering cross-section of hydrogen is signi /uniFB01 cantly larger than that of many other elements, hydrogen is the dominant incoherent scatterer in most hydrogen-containing compounds causing self-di /uniFB00 usion. Therefore, QENS has been widely utilized in investigations of proton conductors such as hydrated BaZrO3, 203,204 BaCeO3, 205 and La0.8 Ba1.2 GaO3.9. 206 Analysis of the di /uniFB00 usion of lithium ions using QENS requires more stringent experimental conditions than that of proton conductors because of the low incoherent cross-section of lithium. 207,208 7 Li enriched materials are often necessary for high quality QENS measurement because of the small incoherent scattering cross-section and high neutron absorptivity of 6 Li (9.4 × 10 -26 m 2 ). Recently, the coherent scattering signal of oxygen has been applied in QENS to study the oxide ion di /uniFB00 usion. 209,210

Ion di /uniFB00 usion in grains has been described by several models. 212 For instance, the classical Chudley -Elliott (CE) model 213 is based on the assumption that an ion jump occurs in a lattice in random directions with a constant jump distance a .

where Q is the momentum transfer, τ -1 is the jump frequency, and a is the average jump distance. In the Singwi -Sjo ander (SS) model, 214 an ion jump is assumed to occur alternatively between oscillatory motion and directed motion with an exponential distribution of jump distance. Finally, in the Hall -Ross (HR) model, 215 the ion jump is assumed to occur in a restricted volume with a Gaussian distribution of jump distance.

By /uniFB01 tting the experimental data using the di /uniFB00 usion models, the jump distance and jump frequency can be determined. 200,217 From the derived jump distances, the di /uniFB00 usion pathway can be veri /uniFB01 ed by referencing to the crystallographic distances between mobile ion sites. 205,218,219 In the perovskite-type Yb-doped SrCeO3 proton conductor, the jump distance of protons was determined to be 4.0 Å, close to the mean O -Odistance (3.2 Å) of the reported crystal structure. 218 Similarly, for lithium conductors Li7P3S11, Mori et al. 200 reported that the lithium jump distance coincide with the average bond length between Li ions.

With jump frequency and jump distance in hand, the random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r can be obtained using Einstein -Smoluchowski relation (eq 9). 199 For small Q , HWHM is approximated as ΔΓ ( Q ) = D r Q 2 . For large Q , by /uniFB01 tting the Q 2 -dependent HWHM according to the SS model, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients D r of Li-ion conductors 7 Li7P3S11 200 and Li5La3Ta2O12 208 at around 473 K were calculated to be 5.7 × 10 -10 m 2 s -1 (Figure 12c) and 10 -10 m 2 s -1 , respectively. Analogous to other techniques, the activation barrier E a of ion motion in fast-ionic conductor was derived by using an Arrhenius plot. 205 -220

In addition, the local ion motion within a few Angstroms can be investigated by QENS via the elastic incoherent scattering factor (EISF), extracted from the ratio of elastic intensity to the sumofelastic and inelastic intensity. The elastic line is originated from neutron di /uniFB00 raction with the nuclei of the scattering species over a /uniFB01 nite volume by its motion. 216 Therefore, the EISF can be used to di /uniFB00 erentiate between local ion motions, as displayed in Figure 12d, e.g., a rotational jump between two sites (I), rotational di /uniFB00 usion on the surface of a sphere of radius R (II), rotational di /uniFB00 usion on the circumference of a circle of radius R (III), and di /uniFB00 usion within the volume of a sphere of radius R (IV). The EISF data of t h e proton conductor SrCe0.95 Yb0.05 H0.02 O2.985 revealed that during the proton residence time at an oxygen site, the proton rotates around its attached oxygen for approximately 50 revolutions before jumping and attaching to the next oxygen ion. 221 The EISF of polycrystalline BaZr0.85 Y0.15 O2.975 · H2O is similar to curve I in Figure 12d, which indicated a rotational jump between two sites, yielding a jump distance of a = 3.1 Å. 219

Temperature-dependent ion reorientation motion can be investigated using neutron /uniFB01 xed-window scans (NFWSs). 222 In the NFWS, only the intensity of elastic-scattered neutrons with zero-energy transfer is measured as a function of temperature. At low temperatures, the rate of ion reorientation motion is low; hence, the quasi-elastic component is too narrow to be separated from the pure elastic component with /uniFB01 nite resolution. In this case, it is di /uniFB03 cult to distinguish elastic and quasi-elastic components; therefore, the intensity of elastic scattered neutrons is maximized (normalized to 1 in Figure 12e). However, at high temperatures, the rate of reorientation motion is high, resulting in a wider quasi-elastic component than the energy resolution of the instrument. Under these circumstances, the quasi-elastic component collapses and contributes no signi /uniFB01 cant intensity to that of elastic components at zero energy transfer in FWS. At moderate temperatures, the increasing rate of reorientation leads to a noticeable decrease in quasi-elastic scattering intensity at zero energy transfer. NFWS curves usually consist of a step-like decrease of the elastic intensity as a function of the temperature. 223 In the temperature-dependent NFWS for the Na-ion conductor Na2B12H12 displayed in Figure 12e, the onset temperature of approximately 240 -250 K after ballmilling indicates that the B12H12 2 -anion reorientation frequency reaches the order of 10 8 s -1 according to the neutron energy transfer. 224

3.1.1.5. Muon Spin Relaxation. Muon spin relaxation ( μ + SR) is a characterization technique that analyzes the e /uniFB00 ects of implanted spin-polarized muons on a material. The sensitivity of implanted positive muons ( μ + ) to the local magnetism and the time evolution of spin polarization makes this technique capable of probing the ion di /uniFB00 usion in solids. The ion di /uniFB00 usion in the sample perturbs the embedded muon, allowing the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient to be extracted from analysis of the perturbation. Comparing with QENS, the sample mass required for μ + SR measurement is much smaller. 225 μ + SR has been successfully applied to study lithium and sodium ion transport, 226 -237 which require long data collection time by QENS, although most of these studies are related to battery electrode materials (i.e., mixed conductors) and only a few cases were found for pure ionic conductors. In the following, we will focus on the

extraction of the random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient and activation energy from μ + SR, with examples from both solid-state electrolyte and electrode materials.

Muonspin relaxation is caused by the asymmetry of the spatial distribution of positrons produced by the decay of polarized particles. Ion di /uniFB00 usion a /uniFB00 ects the local nuclear magnetic /uniFB01 eld and the muon decay behavior for positron production. By measuring the asymmetry and time-domain spectrum of positrons generated by the decay, we can obtain the polarization function in the sample, so as to explore ion transport properties of the sample, shown in Figure 13a. The acquisition of the random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r by muons is based on the assumption that the /uniFB01 eld /uniFB02 uctuation rate is equal to the ion jump frequency, 226 which is given by 238

where Ni is the number of accessible lattice sites in the i th ion jump path, Z ν , i is the vacancy fraction of the destination sites, ai is the jump distance between lattice sites, and ν is the calculated /uniFB02 uctuation rate. 228 These parameters are determined according to the speci /uniFB01 c material structure. In consideration of the di /uniFB00 erent ion jump paths, it should be noted that the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r evaluated from eq 12 is slightly di /uniFB00 erent from D r in eq 1. For instance, for Li x CoO2, 226 there are two possible Li-ion jump paths along the ab plane, denoted by the dashed line (jump to the site of the nearest Li vacancy, N 1 = 6, Zv ,1 = 1 -x , and a 1 is equal to the length of the a -axis) and solid lines (hop to the interstitial site located at the center of the oxygen tetrahedron, N 2 = 3, Zv ,2 = 1, = a a / 3 2 ) as shown in Figure 13b.

μ + SRcan provide information on random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r . For lithium ionic conductors Li 4 Ti5 O12, the /uniFB01 eld distribution width ( Δ ) began to decrease gradually above approximately 200 K, indicating the onset of lithium ion motion that can be detected by μ + SR. In this work, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r was

μ + SR can be used to examine the ionic dynamics in the intrinsic crystalline lattice without extrinsic interferences, such as those from the grain boundaries or defects, as occurs in the traditional electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique. 229 It is favorable to locally resolve the intragrain ions di /uniFB00 usion at the atomic scale, with little restriction on the sample size. The μ + SR technique can measure magnetic /uniFB02 uctuation rates in the range of 10 4 -10 12 Hz, depending on the magnitude of the magnetic /uniFB01 eld at the muon site. This characteristic time window bridges the gap between /uniFB02 uctuation rates detected by NMR and QENS techniques (also shown in Figure 2).

calculated to be (3.2 ± 0.8) × 10 -11 cm 2 s -1 at 200 K. 236 Besides, combined with the conductivity obtained from EIS, the mobile ion concentration can be estimated using the Nernst -Einstein eq (eq 4). In the garnet Li 5+ x La3Zr x Nb2 -x O12, lithium ionic conductivity was observed to vary by 7.5 times as a function of Zr content x , while D r remained almost independent of x . This /uniFB01 nding suggests that ionic conductivity is heavily dependent on the mobile lithium ion concentration, which varies substantially through composition tuning in Li 5+ x La3Zr x Nb2 -x O12. 232

The activation energies probed by μ + SR can be much smaller than that of EIS. 218 -237,239 The di /uniFB00 erent results obtained from these two techniques can be originated from the fact that μ + SR probes intragrain ion transport, whereas EIS measures the ion transport both in grain and across grain boundaries, which can be in /uniFB02 uenced by the sample densi /uniFB01 cation process.

3.1.2. Macroscopic Ion Transport. Macroscopic ion transport processes occur at relatively large time scale (10 -10 to 10 s) and length scales. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is the most common method to probe macroscopic ion transport processes. EIS measures conductivity under electric /uniFB01 eld perturbation, through which the ion di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D σ can be determined if the mobile ion concentration is known. With careful measurements and data analysis, EIS can be used to distinguish contribution between ions and electrons 240 -242 and to tell the ionic transport process within the grain and across grain boundaries. While EIS is not element speci /uniFB01 c, tracer di /uniFB00 usion and pulsed /uniFB01 eld gradient NMR are element speci /uniFB01 c and can be used to directly measure tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients D * . Using the ionic conductivity determined by EIS and D * by tracer di /uniFB00 usion or PFG NMR, the mobile ion concentration can be in principle obtained. Below, we elaborate tracer di /uniFB00 usion and PFG NMR measurements and some recent advances in impedance measurement, with examples of oxide-, lithium-, and silver-ion conductors. In the discussion section 5.4, we tabulate the mobile ion concentrations for several systems for which both ionic conductivity and di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient have been measured.

3.1.2.1. Tracer Di /uniFB00 usion. In tracer di /uniFB00 usion, the isotope (e.g., 2 Hand 18 O) is di /uniFB00 used into the sample to replace the target ions at a user-de /uniFB01 ned temperature and time period, followed by isotope detection. Isotope detection is most commonly performed using time-of/uniFB02 ight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS), from which the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * can be directly obtained. However, other spatially resolved isotopesensitive techniques, such as other mass spectrometry techniques, 243 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or neutron depth pro /uniFB01 ling (NDP), can also be used. The correlation

between the concentration and position in the sample can be described by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where D * is the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient, C is the concentration of position distance x from the surface, C 2 is the semi-in /uniFB01 nite medium ' s initial concentration, C 0 is the concentration (pressure) of the gas phase (injecting gas), 244 erfc is complementary error function, and h = k / D * , where k is the surface exchange coe /uniFB03 cient. By plotting C vs x , the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * can be obtained.

Below, we present examples of isotope detection using SIMS; more details are available in Becker ' s work. 243 SIMS is a surface analysis technique that can be used to characterize the quantity of isotopes on a material surface. It is based on resolving the atomic mass to charge ( m / z ) ratio of ejected particles under ion bombardment. A schematic diagram of the SIMS measurement is shown in Figure 14a. After sputtering away a constant thickness of material from sample surface, the secondary ions are knocked out by the primary ion beam (blue particles in Figure 14a). The intensity of ejected ion species is recorded as a function of the m / z ratio. By repeating this process, the depth pro /uniFB01 le of di /uniFB00 erent element isotopes can be tracked.

Therefore, the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient and activation energy can be obtained by SIMS. In Figure 14b, from the oxygen d e p t h p r o /uniFB01 l e o f t h e o x i d e - i o n c o n d u c t o r (Y2O3)2(Sc2O3)9(ZrO2)89 with and without a silver layer (silver was added to increase the rate of surface oxygen exchange), the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * was observed to fall in the range from 10 -8 to 10 -7 cm 2 s -1 between 600 and 900 ° C. The activation energy E a was determined to be 0.9 eV through a linear /uniFB01 tting of ln( D * ) vs 1/ T . 245

One of the major di /uniFB03 culties in measuring the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient is that the isotope is usually introduced into the sample in the vapor or liquid phase, which currently limits the technique to proton and oxide-ion conductors. In such measurements, water and other H or O residual groups must be removed for the accuracy of the experimental results. 246 If vapor/liquid phases containing Li, Na, Mg, F, etc., can be applied, tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients can be in principle measured for a wide variety of ionic conductors. In addition to solid -gas and solid -liquid isotope exchange, solid -solid isotope exchange is also possible. Hu et al. 247 assembled a symmetric battery cell based on two 6 Li foil electrodes. By applying a constant current, 6 Li will be stripped from one end and deposited onto the other 6 Li metal electrode depending on the direction of the current. Thus, a concentration gradient of 6 Li at the interface between two 6 Li foils and the solid electrolyte can be created, enabling further analysis using spatially resolved techniques such as MRI and SIMS. We believe that a similar method can be employed to study Na and Mg conductors, for which a symmetric battery cell can be built upon these alkali and alkaline-earth metals.

3.1.2.2. Pulsed Field Gradient Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The concept of a gradient /uniFB01 eld was proposed in the 1950s, when it was observed that the use of spin echo technology could eliminate the nonuniform broadening of spectral lines caused by a gradient magnetic /uniFB01 eld as the broad component does not give any echo signal. The most common pulse sequence for the PFG NMR method is shown in Figure 15a. In PFG NMR experiment, two gradient pulses (a gradient magnetization is applied along the z -direction) with duration δ and interval Δ are added to the simple echo pulse (i.e., a 90 ° radio frequency (RF) pulse followed by a 180 ° RF pulse). By virtue of these two gradient pulses, long-range di /uniFB00 usion processes can be probed. The NMR echo amplitudes for simple echo measurement and for that with gradient pulses are di /uniFB00 erent only if long-range di /uniFB00 usion of the probed ion (e.g., Li) occurs at

the relevant PFG NMR time scale. The tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * can be calculated via Stejskal and Tanner equation: 248,249

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where E and E 0 are the signal intensity at t = 0 and t = 2 τ , respectively, γ is the nuclear magnetogyric ratio, g is the PFG strength, δ is the duration of the gradient /uniFB01 eld, and Δ is the di /uniFB00 usion time (or the interval between two gradient pulses). By plotting the logarithm E / E 0 vs -γ 2 g 2 δ 2 ( Δ -δ /3), the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient can be obtained from the slope of the linear /uniFB01 tting.

PFG NMR techniques are generally sensitive to the translational movement of probed ions at time scales of 10 -2 to 1 s and a length scale of approximately 10 μ m; hence, this technique can be used to probe long-range transport. The Li-ion di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * obtained from 7 Li PFG NMR echo attenuation curves of LGPS 36,178 is consistent with the extrapolated experimental di /uniFB00 usivity from ionic conductivity measurements and the computed di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient Dab assuming that Li + di /uniFB00 usion only occurs in the ab plane, as shown in Figure 15b. This /uniFB01 nding demonstrates that macroscopic Li transport in LGPS is predominantly a result of microscopic di /uniFB00 usion along the ab plane.

By tuning g and Δ , di /uniFB00 usion processes at di /uniFB00 erent time and length scales can be probed. Previous works have clearly demonstrated that a wide distribution of di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients exists at di /uniFB00 erent time and length scales even in the same material. In (Li 2 S)7 (P2S5)3 , Hayamizu et al. characterized lithium ionic di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients D * using PFG NMR. As shown in Figure 15c, at a /uniFB01 xed gradient strength g = 9.4 Tm -1 , echo attenuation (i.e., E / E 0) was measured as a function of di /uniFB00 usion time, changing from 25 to 75 ms. At short di /uniFB00 usion time (purple line), a perfect linear correlation between E / E 0 and -γ 2 g 2 δ 2 ( Δ -δ /3) was observed. As the di /uniFB00 usion time increased, the deviation from perfect linearity became increasingly pronounced. When the di /uniFB00 usion time (i.e., Δ ) became longer, the average speed of ion transport was reduced (i.e., a smaller slope as observed in Figure 15c). This /uniFB01 nding suggests that the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients di /uniFB00 er at di /uniFB00 erent length scales. Similarly, if the di /uniFB00 usion time is set at 30 ms, upon increasing the gradient strength from 7.3 to 17.4 Tm -1 , to follow di /uniFB00 usion processes at decreasing time scale, deviation from linearity was also observed. Below 14.9 Tm -1 , an exponential function remained su /uniFB03 cient to /uniFB01 t the PFG NMR curve, which suggests that lithium-ion di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients are polydisperse and may vary smoothly as a function of length scales. Measurement with smaller g probes transport of the lithium ions at a faster rate, and thus over a longer transport distance during the same di /uniFB00 usion time Δ . We further note that the ion transport distance is assumed to be the mean free path, which is de /uniFB01 ned in gas kinetics. However, for the largest g at 17.4 Tm -1 , the echo attenuation curve cannot be /uniFB01 t even by an exponential function. Rather, strong /uniFB02 uctuation was observed in the attenuation curve, especially in the region marked with blue dashed circles in Figure 15d. This /uniFB02 uctuation likely indicates the presence of an additional ion transport process at a similar time scale with dramatically di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients, which may correspond to ion transport across grain boundaries or collisions with the immobile anion groups.

3.1.2.3. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most important and widely used techniques to measure the ionic conductivity of materials. The activation energy can be evaluated by variable-temperature EIS, and the long-range di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D σ can be calculated by the Einstein -Nernst eq (eq 4) if the mobile ion concentration is also known. In section

5.3, we show detailed examples to emphasize that log( σ T ) vs 1/ T should be plotted instead of log( σ ) to estimate activation energy and prefactor.

Acommonwaytomeasureimpedance spectra is by applying a sinusoidal voltage signal as a function of frequency on sample and measuring the current response. 250 A typical impedance instrument can measure impedance in the range of 10 -2 and 10 8 Ω . If a high resistance analyzer is equipped, a broader range can be accessed. The electrochemical process including ionic motion can be resolved by measuring the frequency-dependent electrical conductivity and /uniFB01 tting the impedance spectra with an electric circuit model.

Impedance spectra are usually complicated by the presence of both grains and grain boundaries which exhibit di /uniFB00 erent ion transport properties. Because most ionic conductors are polycrystalline, it is important to understand the role of grain boundaries on the ionic motion. The brick layer model is the most commonly accepted model for quantitative separation of grain boundary contribution from bulk contribution. 251 In this model, all grain boundaries are assumed to be identical. 252 On the basis of the brick layer model, the grain and grain boundary contributions to Li-ion conductivity were distinguished from the complex impedance plane in Li10SnP2S12 when lowering the temperature to -120 ° C, whereas at above -60 ° C, the detection of bulk response was out of the limit of the impedance analyzer, 253 as shown in Figure 16a,b. More accurate analysis of bulk resistance at a higher temperature range can be obtained from the modulus plot, as demonstrated for Li-ion conductor Li 1+ x Al x Ti2 -x (PO4)3. 254

The microelectrode-based method, on the other hand, can measure intragrain ion transport irrespective of microstructural e /uniFB00 ects, such as grain boundaries and sample density. 255 Because the microstructural e /uniFB00 ects were excluded, a 3 orders of magnitude increase in the Li + bulk conductivity (from 3.16 × 10 -6 to 5.63 × 10 -3 S cm -1 ) was reported by doping 0.1 -0.15 mol Al in LiTi2(PO4)3 (LTP) single crystals, 252,255 which was attributed to additional Li + sites at the M3 (Wycko /uniFB00 36 f ) introduced by dopants. Therefore, a fast-conducting pathway is opened by the displacement of Li + at M1 sites (Wycko /uniFB00 6 b ) to the nearest-neighboring M3 sites. In the work of AgCl polycrystal, by positioning the probe on top of a grain or grain boundary area, the grain and grain boundary silver ionic conductivities are distinguished, as shown in Figure 16c,d. 256 Microelectrodes were further applied to investigate the anisotropic distribution of phases in nitrogen-doped zirconia according to the local nitrogen conductivity. 257

Despite of the widespread utilization of EIS, a recently interlaboratory study 258 has pointed out the relative uncertainty when reproducing impedance measurements in thiophosphatebased electrolytes. This work emphasized the need to more rigorously consider the measurement conditions when comparing the impedance data between di /uniFB00 erent works, such as a uniform sample geometry, density, measurement atmosphere, etc.

## 3.2. Structure

3.2.1. Long-Range Structure. Only ions migrating over a rather long distance can result in observable ionic conductivity, which is primarily determined by the long-range structure of the material. X-ray, neutron, and electron di /uniFB00 raction can all be used to probe long-range structures. From Bragg ' s law, the lattice volume and lattice parameters can be obtained. With highquality di /uniFB00 raction data, e.g., single-crystal and synchrotron data, subtler information that a /uniFB00 ect ion transport processes is accessible, such as the polyhedral volume, bottleneck size, anisotropic thermal motion of atoms (indicative of migration pathway), and atom coordinates. Below, we discuss the characterizations of long-range structures of lithium, oxygen, sodium, copper, and silver ion conductors and the correlations between long-range structures and ion transport properties.

3.2.1.1. X-ray Di /uniFB00 raction. X-ray di /uniFB00 raction (XRD) is one of the most commonly adopted tools for characterizing the longrange, averaged structure of materials and can be performed on both powder and single-crystal samples. Single-crystal di /uniFB00 raction provides frames (or 2D slices) of the reciprocal space, through which part of the reciprocal space (determined by instrumental resolution) can be reconstructed in three dimensions (3D). In powder di /uniFB00 raction, however, 3D information on the reciprocal space is collapsed into a simple curve of Bragg scattering intensity vs 2 θ (or d spacing or scattering vector Q ). Analysis of such a powder di /uniFB00 raction pattern is intrinsically much more challenging than that of single crystal di /uniFB00 raction, especially for fast ionic conductors that are rich in disorder and distortions.

With a commonly used Cu K α ( λ = 1.5406 Å) X-ray source and XRD scans with 2 θ up to 90 ° , the smallest d spacing that can be probed is approximately 1.1 Å (if at the upper 2 θ limit, the signal remains three times stronger than background /uniFB02 uctuation, i.e., I &gt; 3 σ ). With such quality of data, usually the lattice symmetry and lattice parameters can be reliably extracted, but other structural parameters, such as atomic coordinates or thermal parameters, cannot. In contrast, synchrotron XRD usually exhibits excellent counting statistics even at a d -spacing much lower than 1 Å (e.g., 0.6 Å), enabling accurate determination of site occupancies and anisotropic thermal parameters for heavy scatters. However, for light elements (such as H, Li, and even O), such detailed structural parameters are still unattainable. Polyhedral volumes, site disorders, and other structural factors have been investigated in a series of studies with the help of X-ray powder di /uniFB00 raction (XRPD) re /uniFB01 nement and related to ion transport properties, providing structural insights for the design of high-conductivity ionic conductors. 103 Additionally, peak splitting is indicative of symmetry descending toward lower symmetry. 259 -261 Changes in the relative peak intensities may arise from site disorder or polyhedral size variations. 8 In some works, stacking and coloring faults of ionic conductors with layered honeycomb structure have been studied by re /uniFB01 nement of XRPD data. 262 -264 Stacking and coloring faults are common in layered materials. Stacking faults, which arise from irregular stacking of layers, often result in asymmetry of di /uniFB00 raction peaks. Coloring faults represent stacking disorder without variations in the local octahedral orientations or site symmetry. By contrast, these variations are always coupled with stacking faults. In the work on Na-ion conductors by Seibel et al., the coloring e /uniFB00 ect originating from B ′ (Sn i n Na3 -x Sn2 -x Sb x NaO6) and B ′′ (Na i n Na3 -x Sn2 -x Sb x NaO6) sites mixing was derived to be approximately 21% of the total faulting by re /uniFB01 ning the site occupancies. More complicated defects, such as the number faults proposed by Khalifah and co-workers, can also be present in honeycomb layered materials. 265,266

Single-crystal X-ray di /uniFB00 raction (SC-XRD) remains the best choice for structural determination of fast ionic conductors. 267 -269 Subtle monoclinic distortion can be resolved in Li3La3W2O12 by SC-XRD 100 from splitting of the 101 and 101 peaks, which is otherwise undetectable in laboratory XRPD data.

Using SC-XRD, Ramos et al. 267 observed a redistribution of Na + in Na11Sn2SbS12 (NSSS) compared with isostructural Na11Sn2PS12 (NSPS). For the same Na content, Na + ions are depopulated from framework sites present in NSPS to occupy an additional interstitial Na6 site in NSSS, which possesses high site energy and function as an interconnection site for Na migration, as illustrated by the arrows in Figure 17a. The depopulation of Na from the framework sites leads to higher fraction of vacancy in major di /uniFB00 usion pathways. The resulting preferred sodium di /uniFB00 usion pathways of Na 11Sn2SbS12 marked in Figure 17a were proposed on the basis of the re /uniFB01 ned anisotropic thermal parameters of Na + , as displayed of ellipsoids in Figure 17b. A lower ionic conductivity, nevertheless, resulted from the stronger electrostatic interaction between Na + and S 2 -due to the more ionic Sb -S bonds in Na 11Sn2SbS12 than in NSPS. The ionic nature of the bonds was speculated based on the electronegativity di /uniFB00 erences between Sb (1.82, Allred -Rochow scale), P (2.06, Allred -Rochow scale), and S (2.44, Allred -Rochow scale). This work provides insights into the complex e /uniFB00 ect of substitution on the properties of ion transport. In some cases, even the positions of Li can be determined from singlecrystal XRD data. Awaka et al. located the Li positions in t -Li7La3Zr2O12 using a Fourier di /uniFB00 erence map. 270 In addition, a modulated structure resulting from lithium chain ordering was determined for the battery cathode LiFeBO 3 using single-crystal XRD. 271

To summarize, with synchrotron X-ray sources, powder di /uniFB00 raction can be used to accurately determine structural parameters such as atomic coordinates, site occupancies, and thermal parameters (except for light elements such as H and Li). 272 -274 From this information, the bond length can then be derived from accurate atomic coordinates, and the ion jump distances and extents of cation -cation and cation -anion electrostatic interactions can be estimated. 31 Similarly, the polyhedral volume, bottleneck size, and coordination environment can also be determined. 275,276 From single-crystal di /uniFB00 raction, detailed structural parameters for light elements, such as Li, can also be derived, which is crucial for understanding the structure and ion transport correlations for a wide range of materials, including Li + , O 2 -, and F -conductors.

3.2.1.2. Neutron Di /uniFB00 raction. Neutron di /uniFB00 raction is in many senses complementary to X-ray di /uniFB00 raction. Neutron di /uniFB00 raction is based on physics similar to that of X-ray di /uniFB00 raction, except for a di /uniFB00 erent set of atomic scattering powers. 211,277 Unlike X-ray di /uniFB00 raction, scattering lengths and hence scattering cross sections (scale with the power of scattering length) of neutron di /uniFB00 raction are not proportional to electron density (or atomic number). Therefore, neutron di /uniFB00 raction can probe light elements such as H, Li, and Na and distinguish between isotopes and elements with similar X-ray cross sections (such as Fe/Mn and Sn/Sb). The scattering factors of di /uniFB00 erent atoms with neutrons also decays much slower than with X-rays with respect to the d -spacing; therefore, information at a d -spacing below 0.5 Å is usually attainable using neutron di /uniFB00 raction.

Neutron powder di /uniFB00 raction can be used to locate light atoms such as Li (Figure 18a). 50,269,278 -280 In Li 1.3 Al0.3 Ti1.7(PO4)3 (LATP), a structural model without any lithium, was /uniFB01 rst re /uniFB01 ned against the neutron powder di /uniFB00 raction data, based on which Fourier di /uniFB00 erence map was calculated. 278 Because of the negative coherent scattering length of Li ( -1.90 f m ) 211 with neutrons, the negative intensities in the Fourier di /uniFB00 erence map are indicative of the exact positions of Li within the LATP structure. As inferred in Figure 18a, very strong negative intensities were observed at (0,0,0) and (0.11, 0.33, 0.08) (marked as Li1 and Li3), corresponding to Li occupancy at these two sites. This redistribution of Li + to Li3 sites has also been reported elsewhere 50 and has been attributed to additional electrostatic repulsion induced with increasing Li content. 281,282 However, we note that Ti is also a negative scatterer in neutron di /uniFB00 raction. Whether positions with negative intensities indeed correspond to Li should be analyzed further. Bond valence analysis is potentially useful in this regard. Not only the position of lithium or sodium atoms but also the lightest element H can be identi /uniFB01 ed in deuterated samples (the coherent scattering length is 6.67 f m for 2 H) 211 from neutron di /uniFB00 raction, e.g., in proton conductors with antiperovskite structure, leading to the identi /uniFB01 cation of hydroxide ( -OH) bond orientations. 283,284 Eilbracht et al. 285 discovered hydroxide ( -OH) bond orientations in antiperovskite lithium ion conductors Li 2 Br(OD) and its high-temperature modi /uniFB01 cation LiBr · D2O, using a Fourier di /uniFB00 erence map for a certain plane (the triangular OLi 6 octahedral surface), as displayed in Figure 18b. In Li2Br(OD), deuterium atoms were observed to be located at 12-fold sites, thus having OH bonds pointing toward edges of OLi 6 octahedra, whereas OH bonds in LiBr · D2O pointed toward octahedral faces. Combined with 2 H-NMR results obtained in the same

work, 12-fold hopping of deuterons between OLi6 octahedral edges was deduced. In Y-doped BaZrO3 proton conductor, neutron powder di /uniFB00 raction revealed evidence of deuterium superstructure, which is linked to the superstructure of yttrium dopant discovered by Y-resonant XRD. 286 The ordered dopant structures were predicted to strongly enhance the proton conductivity. 287

Isotropic/anisotropic thermal parameters of atoms are often indicative of preferred directions of atom motions. Using neutron di /uniFB00 raction, which is more sensitive to light elements (most mobile ions are light elements), preferred di /uniFB00 usion pathways can be inferred from thermal parameters. 279 Thermal parameters are related to the decay in intensity vs the d -spacing. Neutron di /uniFB00 raction can probe much smaller d -spacings than Xray di /uniFB00 ractions and can thus more accurately determine thermal parameters. In the garnet-type lithium-ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), 288 anisotropic thermal parameter ellipsoids pointing along the Li(24 d ) -Li(96 h ) -Li(48 g ) -Li(96 h ) -Li(24 d ) direction, as displayed in the left of Figure 18c, indicate that the preferred di /uniFB00 usion pathways of LLZO involve 24 d sites. 289 -291 Alternatively, the maximum entropy method (MEM) can also be applied to analyze the di /uniFB00 usion path, resulting in a similar conclusion (Figure 18c right). The use of MEM can result in better resolution and a non-Gaussian probability distribution of electron/nuclear density maps in contrast to the routinely used Fourier synthesis, which is critical for studies of ion dynamics (or di /uniFB00 usion). However, this method requires great caution in interpreting the data as spurious features may arise, and the MEM maps, as often displayed in user-de /uniFB01 ned iso-surfaces, can sometimes be misleading. We note that the Li-ion di /uniFB00 usion path in LATP obtained using neutron di /uniFB00 raction and MEM analyses is in fact di /uniFB00 erent from that of other works. 87,187,292 In these works, LiO4 tetrahedra were shown to be involved in the lithium migration process, similar to

Compared with the pristine sample, such tilting was observed to be suppressed after quenching.

the /uniFB01 ndings of MEM and neutron di /uniFB00 raction analysis. However, the di /uniFB00 usion path detoured from central 24 d sites and proceeded through tetrahedral corners, hopping from one octahedral site to another, according to the Li trajectories derived by MD simulations.

Upon re /uniFB01 nement, single-crystal neutron di /uniFB00 raction can provide more accurate information on site occupancies and thermal parameters than neutron powder di /uniFB00 raction and has been adopted to investigate fast ionic conductors. 293,294 Because of the ambiguity of the oxygen distribution in cubic stabilized zirconia, single-crystal time-of/uniFB02 ight neutron di /uniFB00 raction was used to investigate the composition e /uniFB00 ect on oxygen occupancies in a cubic yttria-stabilized zirconia oxygen conductor. 294,295 From the calculated Fourier di /uniFB00 erence map, the displacement of oxygen atoms to 48 g sites (in the ⟨ 100 ⟩ direction) and to a smaller extent to 32 f sites (in the ⟨ 111 ⟩ direction) was proved. Using a Fourier di /uniFB00 erence map, subtle site splitting in the oxide-ion conductor La 1 -x Ba1+ x GaO4 -x /2 can also be visualized, in which the oxide-ion conduction proceeds via the cog wheel mechanism. 133 Because of the simultaneous existence of GaO 4 and Ga2O7 groups during dynamic exchange, the O3 site with lower density corresponds to the exchanged oxygen atom during breaking and reforming of Ga2O7 groups.

3.2.1.3. Electron Di /uniFB00 raction. The scattering factors of elements in electron di /uniFB00 raction are similar to those in XRD, i.e., directly related to the electron density. However, in transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron di /uniFB00 raction (SAED) under annular dark /uniFB01 eld (ADF) mode, such as the low-angle ADF (LAADF), high-angle annular dark /uniFB01 eld (HAADF), and annular bright /uniFB01 eld (ABF) modes, is in principle locally sensitive to light elements such as H, O, and Li. 296 -300

In terms of structural information, SAED patterns can reveal rich structural details (such as structural modulation and local ordering patterns of ions and/or vacancies) similar to single- crystal di /uniFB00 racton. 301 -309 For example, in the Li-ion conductor La(1 -x )/3 Li x NbO3 perovskite, out-of-plane tilting of NbO6 octahedra was observed in the sample without quenching from SAED patterns taken in di /uniFB00 erent crystallographic directions. 301,304 The symbols of ε ′ , ζ , ω in Figure 19 indicate the presence of NbO6 octahedral tilting, twin boundaries, and modulation of La atoms, respectively. After quenching, both tilting of NbO 6 octahedra and La modulation were observed to be suppressed. These structural features are important for understanding ion transport in crystalline solids. For instance, in La(1 -x )/3 Li x NbO3, the absence of domain boundaries and strong La modulation were observed at the same time for the composition with x = 0.07, which possesses the highest ionic conductivity among all compositions. It was then speculated that La modulation might facilitate migration of Li ions. 301 However, electron di /uniFB00 raction is intrinsically statistically insigni /uniFB01 cant; therefore, structural veri /uniFB01 cations from other experimental and computational techniques are needed.

3.2.2. Short-Range Structure. Local structure can greatly a /uniFB00 ect ion transport. Pair distribution function analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can be used to characterize the local structure of materials. Local distortion, site disorder, coordination environment, and defects can all be studied using these tools. Below, we illustrate the use of these techniques in investigation of ion transport with examples of proton, oxygen, lithium, sodium, copper, and silver ion conductors.

3.2.2.1. Pair Distribution Function. Pair distribution function (PDF) data consists of both Bragg and di /uniFB00 use scattering information. Therefore, PDF data probes not only long-range structures, such as lattice parameters, site occupancy, and displacement parameters, but also short-range structures, such as local distortion. 310 -312 The PDF measures the probability of /uniFB01 nding pairs of atoms at a distance r , where r is

the radial distance in real space and is thus often indicative of jump distances for mobile ions. Take the Cu-ion conductor CuI as an example, as shown in Figure 20a, Cu + jump distances, namely the shortest Cu -Cu pair distance, were observed during the phase transition from γ -CuI to α -CuI at temperatures between 300 and 773 K (Figure 20a). 311 Pair distribution functions of CuI samples were measured. At room temperature, the /uniFB01 rst peak at approximately 2.6 Å can be decomposed into two Gaussian components at 2.61 and 2.81 Å, corresponding to Cu -I pairs with some disordered Cu sites. Upon phase transition to α -CuI at 773 K, the aforementioned peak splits into four Gaussian peaks at 2.48, 2.78, 2.95, and 2.49 Å. These arising peaks correspond to four atom pairs between the newly created 8 c (tetrahedral center) and 32 f (tetrahedral corner) sites: Cu -Cu pairs (32 f -32 f , 8 c -32 f , and 8 c -8 c ) and a Cu(32 f ) -I pair, revealing signi /uniFB01 cantly di /uniFB00 erent jump distances of Cu + ions in α -CuI.

Although PDF data /uniFB01 tting is often utilized to verify a structure against a proposed structural model using the small box method (least-squares re /uniFB01 nement, similar to Rietveld re /uniFB01 nement), 18,247 some cases indicate that describing local distortion using the small box method and an averaged structural model is inadequate. 251,313 This inadequacy stems from the highly restrained /uniFB01 tting of a small number of parameters in small box modeling. Compared with small box methods, the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) method as a large box method allows simultaneous /uniFB01 tting in real and reciprocal space. Large models including thousands of atoms are involved in large box methods. It is thus possible to investigate various types of disorder in large box modeling. With a model crystal of suitable size, e.g., a 20 × 20 × 20 supercell for a grid size of Δ h = 0.05 rlu , the defect structure and/or disorder of materials can be determined using RMC for a number of materials. 311,314 -317 For instance, in oxide-ion conductor δ -Bi 2 O3, Hull et al. revealed a distorted anion arrangement around Bi 3+ with RMC modeling. 314 In addition, Norberg et al. utilized RMC to derive information on oxygen vacancy ordering in the oxide-ion conductor Zr0.8 Sc0.2 -x Y x O1.9 . 315

A good example of PDF analysis utilized in probing the local structure is given in Malavasi ' s work 318 where the phase transition of the fast oxide-ion conductor La2Mo2O9 was investigated. Despite the long-range structure change from α (monoclinic) to β (cubic) phase, no substantial change was observed in the local structures, which remained monoclinic. Hence, a peculiar phase-transition mechanism of long-range ordering to dynamic, short-range ordering, preserving the local monoclinic structure, was proposed. 31,316,319 A similar case was also reported for Zr 0.8 Sc0.2 -x Y x O1.9 . 315 Other local information that is derivable from PDF /uniFB01 tting includes site splitting, 310,311 site disorder, 31,320 the location of interstitial atoms, 313,321 the defect structure, 317 and the defect association which is often observed in oxide-ion conductors. 315,322,323 In oxygen-excess conductor La2NiO4+ δ , 310 when the /uniFB01 tting quality indicator of the PDF ( R w) was plotted against the position of one of the oxygen atoms (O4), two local minima were observed (one at x ∼ 0.13 and the other at x ∼ 0.26), as shown in Figure 20b. This /uniFB01 nding suggests that the apical O4 site of NiO 6 octahedra splits into two sites upon the introduction of excess oxygen atoms.

Deviation from long-range structure was also observed in Na conductors. 324,325 Krauskopf et al. 324 investigated local structural e /uniFB00 ects on the ion conduction properties of ' cubic ' and tetragonal Na 3 PS4. The results indicate that although ' c ' -Na3PS4 displays an averaged cubic structure, the local structure remains analogous to that of the tetragonal phase. The higher ionic conductivity of the ' cubic ' phase was attributed to the high defect concentration resulting from the complex local structures. These results indicate that complex defects (such as the coexistence of low-symmetry and high-symmetry domains) may be present in a wide range of fast ionic conductors, motivating a systematic study of fast ionic conductors using local probes such as PDF and NMR.

3.2.2.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The sensitivity of NMRtowardlocal, atomic-scale structure enables its application in the investigations of positional or compositional disorder in solid materials. The six most important NMR interactions are Zeeman interaction, paramagnetic, chemical shift, quadrupolar, dipolar, and J -coupling interactions. We discuss the latter four, which are most relevant to the local structure of fast ionic conductors, in the following paragraph.

Because of orbiting electrons around the nucleus, an e /uniFB00 ective magnetic /uniFB01 eld B ′ is generated proportional to the external /uniFB01 eld B 0 , and thus,

Here σ is a /uniFB01 eld-independent chemical shielding tensor, which is related to the local electronic environment surrounding the target nucleus.

Chemically inequivalent sites possessing di /uniFB00 erent bond types, bond lengths, bond angles, neighboring atoms, and coordination environments can be distinguished from chemical shift interactions. These features of NMR chemical shifts have enabled a considerable amount of research investigating the bonding conditions 100,293,319,326,327 and coordination environments 50,196,328 of ionic conductors.

̈

For example, in the proton conductor CsH 2PO4, H, O, and P atoms are bonded with neighboring atoms in distinct ways (Figure 21a), i.e., chemically inequivalent sites. Distinguishing these sites is essential to attain a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between rotational PO4 anion groups and hopping protons. There are four types of oxygen atoms in CsH2PO4. O1 is the apical oxygen atom of the PO 4 tetrahedron. O2 and O3 are basal oxygen atoms of the PO 4 group; however, O3 is bonded with H through hydrogen bonds. O3 atoms are further classi /uniFB01 ed into acceptor and donor O3 atoms, denoted as O3 a and O3 d , respectively, according to the hydrogen bonds. Later, along with other ion transport measurements, PO 4 group rotation around the P -O1 axis was shown to be easier than that around the P -O2 and P -O3 axes, contributing to proton transport. 293 Du vel et al. 328 (Figure 21b for the oxide-ion conductor Ba0.5 Ca0.5 F2) and Dietrich et al. 319 (Figure 21c for Liion conductor Li2S -P2S5) utilized the NMR technique in similar ways, where various coordination environments were able to be distinguished and semiquantitative analysis of the contribution from individual peaks could be performed. On the basis of such structural information, mobile ion migration and lattice motion in ionic conductors can be distinguished.

Quadrupolar interactions occur with nuclei with spin quantum number I &gt; 1/2 and/or with asymmetric charge distribution. Quadrupolar interaction, on one hand, is very sensitive to local symmetry, as di /uniFB00 erent coordination environments can yield very di /uniFB00 erent quadrupolar coupling constants ( C Q), related to structure deviation from cubic symmetry, and asymmetry factors ( η ), related to deviation from axial symmetry. These parameters were investigated in several works on lithium conductors, revealing various distortion existing in polyhedra. 329 -334 In the oxide-ion conductor Bi 1 -x Sr x VO4 -0.5 x , 134 di /uniFB00 erent coordination environments formed with various extents of Sr substitution in the BiVO 4 structure led to distinct resonances in NMR spectra because of quadrupolar interactions (Figure 22). NMR spectra of the VO x group in various coordination environments, i.e., the V2O7 group with two neighboring Sr atoms and /uniFB01 ve or six neighboring Bi atoms, VO 4 tetrahedra neighboring with two Sr atoms and six Bi atoms, with one Sr atom and seven Bi atoms, and surrounded by eight Bi atoms, were calculated. Very di /uniFB00 erent chemical shifts ( δ ISO ) of each environment and distinct quadrupolar coupling constants ( | C Q | ) were observed. However, NMR peak broadening caused by quadrupolar interaction can be very large, which may mask other important NMR interactions such as chemical shifts, J -coupling and dipolar coupling, making unambiguous analysis of NMR spectra challenging.

J -Coupling originates from indirect coupling through bonds and is relatively less studied in the investigations of ionic conductors. In some proton conductors (e.g., CsH2PO4), J -

coupling has been observed in doublet resonances due to 31 P -1 H J -coupling e /uniFB00 ects. 326

Dipolar interactions arise from interactions of local /uniFB01 elds of nuclei and are not restricted in chemical bonds. The strength of dipolar interactions is a /uniFB00 ected by interatomic distance, dipole orientation, and atomic motion. For a given structure, atomic motion mainly alters the strength of dipolar interactions. With increasing mobility of the probed nucleus, narrowing of the line width due to reduced dipolar interactions is often observed. 55,100,196,289,335 -340 Dynamic information including the onset temperature of ion motion and the ion jump frequency for ionic conductors can be derived. 100,289,335 -338

3.2.2.3. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy. Compared with PDF analysis, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is an element-speci /uniFB01 c technique. In typical XAS measurements, the X-ray energy is tuned close to the absorption edge of the probed element. The absorption coe /uniFB03 cients of the sample are then measured as a function of the X-ray energy. The absorption coe /uniFB03 cient increases substantially at the absorption edge of the element. The absorption edge position contains information regarding the oxidation state of the element. The features before (pre-edge) and after (extended edge) the absorption edge re /uniFB02 ect the local structure surrounding the probed element. In particular, analysis of the extended edge region, often termed extended X-ray absorption /uniFB01 ne structure (EXAFS) analysis, can be facilitated by small-box modeling (similar to Rietveld re /uniFB01 nement). A structural model is re /uniFB01 ned against the EXAFS data, yielding important local structural information, such as bond distances, the coordination number, and the Debye -Waller factor (similar to the thermal parameter in XRD). EXAFS amplitudes in k space decay exponentially as exp( -2 k 2 ε αβ 2 ), where ε αβ is the mean square deviation from R αβ ( R αβ is the mean pair distance of atoms α and β ). ε αβ is often large at elevated temperatures or in materials with a large degree of disorder. Therefore, the decay can be easily observed in fast ionic conductors, which are usually rich in disorder. In addition, ε αβ is even larger for more distant shells from the central atom. All these facts suggest that only nearest-neighbor correlations can be reliably extracted from EXAFS analysis.

XAS has been adopted to extract local structural information, such as the site occupancy, local environment of mobile ions, and conduction pathway before and after superionic phase transition. 341 -343 Boyce et al. 341 resolved the silver ion transport mechanism of AgI from EXAFS results. Ag + ions were proved to occupy tetrahedral sites that are displaced from the tetrahedral center with three I neighbors at r = 2.78 Å and one I neighbor at 2.93 Å. In addition, the amplitude of EXAFS peaks was reduced by 25% to achieve perfect /uniFB01 tting of the spectrum ( R = 0.09), indicating that only 75% of Ag atoms contribute to EXAFS features, as shown in Figure 23a. In the Strock model, which

assumes that two Ag + ions are homogeneously distributed in the bcc lattice formed by I atoms, a poor /uniFB01 tting ( R = 0.60) was achieved (Figure 23b). Upon /uniFB01 tting using the Bu hrer -Ha lg model (Figure 23c), where Ag ions occupy 24 g tetrahedral sites with two I atoms at r = 2.71 Å and two I atoms at r = 2.96 Å, the quality of /uniFB01 tting was similarly poor ( R =0.50). Hence, the model in which only 75% of Ag atoms contribute to the EXAFS feature best to /uniFB01 t the data. On the basis of this proportion, the ratio of Ag residence time τ R and /uniFB02 ight time τ F , i.e., τ R / τ F , was derived to be 3.0 ± 0.6 for AgI at 198 ° C, indicating a jump-di /uniFB00 usion model of Ag ion transport. In another study of a silver conductor α -RbAg4I5, Stutius et al. 344 investigated the variation of shortrange repulsive Ag -Ag correlation under varying temperatures. Onthe basis of the assumption that uncorrelated Ag atoms have a rather broad distribution of Ag -Ag distances and do not contribute signi /uniFB01 cantly to the EXAFS peak intensity, the decreasing amplitude of the Ag -Ag pair with increasing temperature was attributed to weaker correlations between Ag ions at higher temperatures. Similar correlation e /uniFB00 ects were also observed in Cu conductors (e.g., α -CuI). 345

For Cu + ion conductors (e.g., CuCl, CuBr, and CuI), Boyce et al. 342,343 derived the preferred sites of mobile ions and even the preferred di /uniFB00 usion pathways based on a near-neighbor pair correlation function. The signi /uniFB01 cant occupancies at intermediate trigonal sites at high temperature indicate migration in ⟨ 110 ⟩ directions in bcc lattices ( α -AgI, α -CuBr), whereas in fcc materials ( α -CuI, γ -cuprous halides), preferred occupancies at octahedral positions indicate ion transport in ⟨ 111 ⟩ directions through faces shared by tetrahedra and octahedra. Moreover, in these works, the structural essence of the superionic phase transition of these materials was discussed based on XAS data obtained at various temperatures.

3.2.3. Point Defects. The nature and concentration of point defects play crucial role in ion transport. The point defect type a /uniFB00 ects the ion jump mechanism and therefore the jump distance, as illustrated in Figure 2. The defect concentration is usually related to the mobile ion concentration. In this section, we describe how the defect type and concentration are determined by experimental techniques. In addition, local or short-range structure, such as ' disordered ' domains, vacancies, and distortion of the lattice structure, signi /uniFB01 cantly a /uniFB00 ect the di /uniFB00 usion of ions in fast ion conductors. 346

3.2.3.1. Di /uniFB00 use Scattering. Although the short-range defects are usually characterized by electron microscopes, di /uniFB00 use scattering measurement has been extensively used since the 1970s. Di /uniFB00 use scattering is one of two components of total scattering. The other component is Bragg scattering, which measures the long-range, time-averaged component. Di /uniFB00 use scattering measurement is usually designed to rapidly measure a large portion of reciprocal space, usually using single-crystal samples.

Defects in materials, such as stacking faults, substitutions, magnetic disturbances, movement of ions, and lattice relaxation, can be observed in di /uniFB00 use scattering. We note that electrons, Xrays, and neutrons can all be used for di /uniFB00 use scattering measurements. In conventional Bragg di /uniFB00 raction, such signals are considered to be interference, which increases the background signal and reduces the accuracy of Bragg intensity extraction. However, for the characterization of disordered materials, di /uniFB00 use scattering is rather useful. 185 For instance, Pro /uniFB00 en et al. 347 observed two types of defects in oxide-ion conductor calcium-stabilized zirconia:microdomains based on one single oxygen vacancy with relaxed neighboring ions and microdomains based on a pair of oxygen vacancies along ⟨ 111 ⟩ . In another study on oxide-ion conductor yttria-stabilized zirconia, the di /uniFB00 use scattering rings was ascribed to shortrange ordering of oxygen vacancies like that in the pyrochlore structure, which can be depicted as a superstructure of the /uniFB02 uorite type on account of ordering of the anion vacancies forming zigzag chains along the [110] direction. 348

3.2.3.2. Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. Defects in materials can be visualized using scanning transmission electron microscopies (STEM). The spatial resolution of state-of-the-art STEM has reached beyond 0.5 Å by equipping the microscopes with a spherical aberration corrector, and the energy resolution has reached down to 10 meV. A schematic diagram is presented in Figure 24a. 349

Two techniques in the imaging mode of STEM are capable of producing atomic-scale mapping of materials, namely, highangle annular dark/uniFB01 eld (HAADF) imaging and annular bright/uniFB01 eld (ABF) imaging. In addition, two other analytical tools can also be used in STEM: (i) electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to analyze the energy distribution of transmitted electrons and (ii) X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (XEDS) to identify the characteristic X-rays of elements produced by the interaction between the probed sample and electron beam. Combining these techniques, the material chemical information can be studied at the atomic level, 350 identifying the defect type. In perovskite lanthanum lithium titanate (LLTO), Gao et al. 351 used STEM and EELS and found local clustering of the A-site (Wycko /uniFB00 3 b ) vacancies resulting in aggregation of Li atoms, as shown in Figure 24b. On the basis of these results, they proposed

that the Li-ion migration pathway changes from 2D in Li-poor LLTOto 3D in Li-rich LLTO, attributing to the associated local clustering of A-site vacancies and the conglomeration of Li atoms.

In addition, it was revealed using STEM that the modulated crystal structure in Li-ion conductor La (1 -x )/3 Li x NbO3 (LLNO) was derived from high La and O vacancy concentrations. 308 Such structure modulation is absent in La0.33NbO3 (LNO), as shown in Figure 24c. However, ion mobility was restricted by the structure modulation because of deeper local potential wells.

Although an atomic-resolution defect map can be obtained using STEM, it remains di /uniFB03 cult to conclude whether all the defects are carriers and to elucidate the relation between defects and carriers. Therefore, other techniques are necessary to further investigate how defects a /uniFB00 ect ion transport.

3.2.3.3. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. NMR spectroscopy can be employed to investigate point defects because di /uniFB00 erent atoms, atomic groups, and defect structure show resonances at di /uniFB00 erent shifts with di /uniFB00 erent NMR interactions. From magicangle spinning NMR (MAS NMR) and Fourier Transform (FT)-Raman analysis, HPO4 2 -was con /uniFB01 rmed to be the dominate defect in proton conductor Sr-doped LaPO4 (Sr = 0 -7 mol%). 352 The concentration of point defects can be identi /uniFB01 ed by comparing the peak area of point defects with that of other resonances corresponding to lattice sites. For example, 19 F fast MAS NMR spectra of nanocrystalline CaF2 (diameter ∼ 25 nm) revealed the presence of ∼ 0.55% of F -ions in interstitial sites, as observed in Figure 25a. The resonance located at approximately -132 ppm was attributed to interstitial F -, which was observed to be highly mobile at elevated temperatures and to undergo rapid site exchange with regular /uniFB02 uorine sites in the lattice via hopping. An increased concentration of these defects formed in nanocrystalline CaF 2 enhances the /uniFB02 uorine ionic conductivity by nearly 3 orders of magnitude compared with that of bulk CaF2. 353 In oxide-ion conductors, by employing multinuclear variable-temperature solid-state NMR ( 17 O, 51 V, and 31 P NMR), Dunstan et al. observed that a high dopant concentration in /uniFB02 uorite-type bismuth vanadate and phosphate solid electrolytes will disrupt the 3D conduction network of oxide ions and that the coordination /uniFB02 exibility will also a /uniFB00 ect the oxide-ion mobility. 354

3.2.3.4. Other Methods. Other methods are also available to investigate point defects and improve our understanding of how point defects a /uniFB00 ect ion transport. 324 In the chromium K-edge XAS study of (Na0.5 Bi 0.5TiO3)(1 -x )(BiCrO3) x (NBT) perovskite solid solution, Selvamani et al. 355 observed no strong pre-edge peak, which implies that the chromium ion is not in the +6 state. They concluded that chromium sits at the octahedral site of NBT with +3 or +5 valence state, which generates O or Bi/Na vacancies in NBT, respectively. Combining impedance experiments and computational simulation, they proposed that the ionic conductivity is contributed by oxygen vacancies generated by the incorporation of +3 chromium.

For proton conductors, a conventional approach to measure the defect concentration is using thermogravimetric analysis, e.g., to measure the weight gain of dry sample under humid conditions, assuming that the entire weight gain is due to hydration. 46 The defect concentration of other ions can be determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) by measuring the valence state of elements in the sample. Combining the results with the law of charge conservation, the defect concentration can be calculated indirectly. Furthermore, synchrotron-based ambient-pressure XPS can provide element-speci /uniFB01 c information on the electronic structure of materials. In proton conductor BaCe 0.8 Y0.2O3 -δ , the O, Ce, and Y core level as well as resonant valence band spectra revealed that at the onset temperature of proton conductivity the oxygen vacancies are /uniFB01 lled upon water exposure, along with a charge redistribution among lattice O, Ce, and Y, as illustrated in Figure 25b. 217

3.2.4. Lattice Dynamics. Atoms in solids are always oscillating around their equilibrium positions at any temperature above absolute zero. The theory to describe such oscillations is often referred to as lattice dynamics. Optical spectroscopy, such as infrared (IR) and Raman, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), and ultrasonic speed of sound measurements (USOS) have been employed to characterize the frequency of lattice vibration modes. INS is an e /uniFB00 ective technique to study the total phonon density of state (pDOS), while the IR and Raman probe the optical phonon branch and the USOS is used to study acoustic phonon branch. The lattice vibrations may enhance or hinder the di /uniFB00 usion of ions. It has also been demonstrated recently that the ion migration barrier is lower for softer lattices. 29 -31 Modulating the lattice dynamics is considered as an emerging strategy for the discovery of new ionic conductors with enhanced conductivity and stability. Below, we introduce the

techniques to characterize lattice dynamics and discuss its correlation with ion transport for Li-ion, Na-ion, oxide-ion and proton conductors.

3.2.4.1. Inelastic Neutron Scattering. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is a method used to study the atomic or molecular vibrations and other crystal /uniFB01 eld excitations. Neutron scattering is inelastic when energy and momentum exchange occur in the collision event between a neutron and the sample. INS measures the scattering function S ( Q , E ) as a function of momentum transfer Q and energy transfer E , which reveals the phonon density of states (pDOS).

Combined with computational methods, INS can elaborate the e /uniFB00 ects of lattice dynamics on the ion mobility and material stability of ionic conductors. For instance, Paulus et al. 138 claimed that in the oxide-ion conductor SrFeO 3 -x , the reduction of Fe -O -Fe bond strength in the FeO6 octahedra lead to enhanced and phonon-assisted oxygen di /uniFB00 usion, triggered by the dynamical switching of FeO 4 tetrahedral chains between two di /uniFB00 erent directions. Such a dynamically triggered phenomenon helps the oxide ions to easily migrate into the open vacancy channels. For lithium-ion conductors, combining INS and DFT, Muy et al. 29 concluded that the fast Li-ion migration of LISICONs is linked with low-lithium phonon band centers and that their high stability is associated with high anion band centers, as illustrated in Figure 26a.

Analyses of the INS signal provides unique information that can be used to characterize the proton sites because the hydrogen bond strength is a /uniFB00 ected by protons and the relative occupation of the proton sites. In the INS spectra of the proton conductor 50% In-doped BaZrO3 (50In/BZO) 356 in Figure 26b, the weak and broad features centered at 200, 420, 500, and 650 meV suggest O -H bending with some di /uniFB00 erent O -H distances, revealing several distinguishable proton sites in the crystal structure.

3.2.4.2. Optical Spectroscopy. The optical phonon mode and molecular vibration modes of materials can also be characterized using optical spectroscopy (Raman and IR spectroscopy). The molecular vibration, phonons, or other excitations will interact with the incident light, resulting in an energy change of the incident photons. This shift in energy can

be used to reveal the frequency of vibrational modes in the investigated material. 357 The Raman-active vibrations must change the polarizability α of the electron cloud, and IR-active vibrations must change the dipole moment μ of the molecule. Therefore, IR and Raman are considered as complementary techniques. In the near-infrared to near-ultraviolet range, the two techniques are commonly accessible in laboratories and require a much smaller sample volume compared with neutron experiments.

IR and Raman spectroscopy have been applied to study the correlation between bond vibration information and ion motion. 154 In proton conductor BaIn x Zr1 -x O3 -x /2 , Karlsson et al. 203 observed a strong red-shift of the O -H stretching band (Gaussian bands A) in the IR spectrum with increasing In content (Figure 27a), indicating that protons tilt toward adjacent oxygen to form hydrogen bonds. However, the formation of hydrogen bonds lowers the reorientation mobility of protons, thereby hinder the long-range migration.

For tuning the lattice dynamics, in addition to the change in material stoichiometry, mechanical pressure is considered an alternative approach that does not a /uniFB00 ect the material chemistry or processing. By applying compressive strain to the proton conductor BaCe0.8 Y0.2O3 -δ , a strong pressure-dependent increase in the B1 g and B3 g Raman modes (Ce -O stretching mode) was reported, as illustrated in Figure 27b, which implies anisotropic lattice hardening and con /uniFB01 nement in proton transport. 154

3.2.4.3. Ultrasonic Speed of Sound. Ultrasonic speed of sound (USOS) measurement is used to probe lattice sti /uniFB00 ness, Debye frequencies, and pDOS for acoustic phonons. When the ultrasonic signal is applied to one end of the sample, the signal is rapidly transmitted inside, and rebound when the ultrasonic wave reaches the other end of the sample. When the detector receives the backscattered signal, the signal transmitted distance is 2 d ( d is the thickness of the sample). Then, the speed of sound of the transverse waves ( v t ) and longitudinal waves ( v l ) can be calculated using the following equations:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Δ t and Δ l are the time interval between the incident and backscattered transverse and longitudinal waves, respectively. The mean speed of sound v mean, Debye temperature Θ D, and Debye frequency v D can be obtained using eq 18 -20

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where V represent the average volume per atom. The Debye temperature and Debye frequency both re /uniFB02 ect the vibration frequency of phonons in the materials and are directly related to the mean speed of sound. Stronger bonding interactions (i.e., shorter bond lengths) cause an increased mean speed of sound

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

in solids because of higher vibration frequency of phonons. 358 The mean speed of sound is thus a good indicator of phonon properties and lattice sti /uniFB00 ness. For example, a high mean speed of sound is associated with a high average bond strength, high Debye frequency, and high Debye temperature, all of which indicate harder and sti /uniFB00 er lattices.

The cation-substituted Li-ion conductor Li10Ge1 -x Sn x P2S12 exhibits a higher activation barrier in a softer lattice. With increasing Sn 4+ , although the lattice becomes softer, the bottleneck along the di /uniFB00 usion path in the z -direction is tightened and the local ionic bonding between Li + and S 2 -becomes stronger, leading to a higher activation barrier. 33

The underlying correlation between lattice sti /uniFB00 ness and ion transport is complex. By increasing the polarizability of the anion sublattice in Li 6 PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) from Cl to I, the speed of sound decreases, indicating weaker bonds and lower lattice sti /uniFB00 ness. 31 The softer lattice leads to a decrease in the activation barrier; however, the prefactor is also reduced. Because of the prefactor conundrum and other complex structural factors, Li conductivity in Li6PS5 -x Se x Br (0 ≤ x ≤ 1) shows no obvious improvement when its lattice becomes softer. 320 Softening of the lattice vibration frequency is also correlated with sodium-ion transport. 32

## 3.3. Comparisons and Limitations of Experimental Techniques

Each technique that probes ion transport processes is sensitive to a certain range of time scales. QENS (section 3.1.1) is a favorable tool to investigate proton motion and has been applied to probe O and Li, and potentially to Na, although much longer data collection time is expected for Li and Na conductors. μ + SR (section 3.1.1) requires much smaller sample size compared to QENS and is therefore often applied to study Li- and Na-ion transport and can be potentially implemented to investigate other types of ions. NMR relaxometry (section 3.1.1), 2D NMR (section 3.1.1), and PFG NMR (section 3.1.2) can reveal ion dynamic processes at various time scales and will remain valuable for studies of ion transport mechanisms. However, to reveal the exact nature of ion transport processes, complementary techniques such as QENS or DFT modeling are most likely needed. For long-range ion di /uniFB00 usion, impedance spectroscopy (section 3.1.2) has been universally applied to analyze ion conductors of di /uniFB00 erent species, although care should be taken to separate grain and grain boundary contributions. In this regard, measurements with microelectrodes can be useful. The tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient is an important yet often overlooked parameter (section 3.1.2). The task of introducing an isotope to the material will remain a challenge. Once the isotope is introduced to the system, we expect that spatially resolved techniques, such as MRI and NDP, in addition to TOF-SIMS, can be used to determine the spatial distribution of isotopes, thus opening up alternative means to measure tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients. It is worth to clarify that unlike NMR relaxometry and 2D NMR which measure random di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D r , PFG NMR characterizes the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * .

Di /uniFB00 raction techniques have been widely applied in studying the long-range crystal structure of materials for decades. Depending on the light source, di /uniFB00 raction techniques primarily consist of XRD, ND, and ED (section 3.2.1). With detailed re /uniFB01 nement of XRD and ND patterns, the positions of mobile ions in the structure and the corresponding site occupancies can be determined. ND is sensitive to H, Li, and O and is thus a powerful tool to study proton, Li-ion, and oxide-ion conductors.

Li is suggested to be isotope enriched for neutron di /uniFB00 raction using 7 Li because of the large absorption and incoherent scattering of 6 Li.

The local structure can be probed using PDF analysis, XAS, and NMR spectroscopy (section 3.2.2). Atomic pair distances, polyhedral shape, size, and local distortion can be extracted from PDF data. XAS, however, can be considered as selected histograms of the PDF data. When hard X-rays are employed, elements that are detectable in general start with the /uniFB01 rst period of transition metals, i.e., titanium. By using soft X-rays, however, light elements such as O and F can be probed, enabling direct probing of such mobile ions. NMR spectroscopy is another versatile technique that can provide information on the local structure of materials. With appropriate deconvolution of peaks, chemically inequivalent sites, the coordination environment (defects included), jump distances, and the orientations of polyanions can be probed.

Understanding the nature of defects in fast ionic conductors is extremely important but di /uniFB03 cult (section 3.2.3). Di /uniFB00 use scattering has been used to identify the defect nature, e.g. vacancies. Using STEM, spatially resolved spectroscopy analysis at the atomic scale is possible. This method can provide valuable information regarding defect (or carrier) type but cannot quantify the defect concentration. XPS can be used to identify the defect type and estimate the composition of a sample but is only sensitive to the /uniFB01 rst few nanometers of the particle surface, lacking sensitivity to the bulk of the material. NMR spectroscopy can be an extremely useful tool to identify defect type and concentration, provided that enough defects are present in the sample. On the basis of the proposed structure, NMR parameters can be simulated using DFT, leading to precise assignment of NMR resonances.

Phonons, either acoustic or optical, have been recently shown to couple with ion transport to a great extent (section 3.2.4). When measuring the pDOS, inelastic neutron scattering provides a sum over all phonon modes. Nevertheless, the assignment of di /uniFB00 erent bands is crucial, as recently shown by Muy et al., who reported that lithium migration is correlated to the lithium phonon band center. 29 USOS can be used to probe the acoustic phonons and determine the Debye frequencies/

temperature. IR and Raman spectroscopy are exclusively used to monitor the chemistry-induced changes in the optical phonon modes. Similar to INS, accurate assignment of IR and Raman bands are critical to identify the exact phonon modes responsible for superionic conduction. A combination of di /uniFB00 erent approaches is therefore necessary to obtain a complete phonon dispersion spectrum. Recently, pDOS of sodium thiophosphate has been depicted by Zeier and co-workers, 30 combining Raman, EIS, SOS, and INS, making an important /uniFB01 rst step toward a comprehensive characterization of phonon dispersion spectrum in ionic conductors. Figure 28 represents a good summary of the scope these techniques can cover.

## 4. COMPUTATIONAL TECHNIQUES

In this section, we review computational methods used to study ion di /uniFB00 usion and transport in crystalline structures. We discuss the computation of defects and dopants (section 4.1), di /uniFB00 usion mechanisms (section 4.2, section 4.3), and the stability of structures (section 4.4). We then compare the strengths and limitations of current computational techniques (section 4.5).

## 4.1. Formation of Mobile Carriers

Because ionic di /uniFB00 usion in solids is mediated by the hopping of atoms in the crystal lattice, a high concentration of mobile-ion carriers, often in the form of vacancies and interstitials, is crucial to achieve high ionic conductivity. First-principles computation methods have been established for determining the formation energy of point defects, such as vacancy, self-interstitial, dopant, or substitutional atoms in a material, and the e /uniFB00 ects of these defects on the electronic structure and ion transport. 13,359 -362

The formation energy of a defect in a crystal solid is determined by the energy di /uniFB00 erence between the crystal model with the defect and the perfect defect-free crystal plus a reference energy (i.e., chemical potential) of the defect species, which is dependent on the thermodynamic conditions of the materials. 363 -366 Speci /uniFB01 cally, the formation energy E f [ Xq ] of the crystal with the defect Xq with charge q can be calculated as

where E 0 is the energy of the perfect crystal without the defect, ni is the number of atoms of species i that have been added or removed from the crystal to form the defect, and μ i is the chemical potential of the species i . The formation of defects with a nonzero charge q can occur in nonmetallic materials such as ionic solids or semiconductors. The formation of charged defects involves the addition or removal of electrons from the material, and the reference energy of these electrons should be considered and is often given by the Fermi energy /uni03F5 F of the materials at the given stoichiometry and thermodynamic conditions. 363 -370 The chemical potential μ i is a reference energy of the atom species involved in creating the defect 363 -366 and is dependent on thermodynamic variables, e.g., pressure, temperature, concentration, and applied voltage. Therefore, the selection of the values of μ i in eq 21 should re /uniFB02 ect the physical conditions of the materials. For example, the formation of an oxygen vacancy or oxygen interstitial within oxide-ion conductors should be referenced to the partial pressure and temperature of gaseous oxygen under operational conditions, as oxygen ions in the materials exchange with the external gaseous environment. 371 -373 In solid electrolyte or electrode materials for Li-ion batteries, the chemical potential of Li μ Li is related to the applied potential and can be given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ϕ is the applied potential referenced to Li metal and μ Li 0 is the chemical potential of Li metal. For intrinsic defects of the existing elements in the material, the range of chemical potentials is often set to the stable range of μ i in the particular material phase, which can be determined from grand canonical phase diagrams. 374 -376

For many ion conductors that are mediated by the migration of intrinsic defects, the formation energy of these mobile-carrier defects should be considered, in addition to the migration energy barrier, as a part of the total activation energy of the Arrhenius relation for ion transport. 377 -379 First-principles computation can be used to evaluate the formation energy of di /uniFB00 erent types of defects within a given structure and to determine the dominant mobile carriers for ion di /uniFB00 usion by comparing various defects. For example, in a computational study on lithium di /uniFB00 usion within the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), Shi et al. calculated the formation energy and defect concentration for a range of point defects in Li2CO3 (Figure 29a,b), a major component of the SEI, including Li interstitials (Li i , Li i + ), Li vacancies ( Vi , Vi -), and Frenkel pairs (Li FP , Li FP + , Li FP -). 10 The authors observed that positive Li interstitials (Li i + ) had the lowest formation energy in the range of voltages from the potential of Li metal to the voltage corresponding to SEI formation and thus argued that Li i + interstitials are the dominant charge carrier in Li 2 CO3. With this knowledge of the dominant mobile carrier, the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li2CO3 and the SEI was further evaluated by computation, as discussed in section 4.2.

Given that the concentration of intrinsic defects is often limited in pristine materials, doping and substitution have been widely employed to create carriers for improving the ion transport properties of materials. By substituting aliovalent ions in the host, charge-compensating defects of the desired mobile species can be created. For example, to create Li interstitials in NASICON-structured LiTi2(PO4)3, Al 3+ is substituted for Ti 4+ to i nduce extra Li + i nto the structure, f orming Li1+ x Al x Ti2 -x (PO4)3 with high ionic conductivity. 181,380 Although basic heuristic rules and experience with elementary

(c) Preferred migration pathway of an intercalating ion (red atoms) in a spinel oxide structure (O: yellow atoms), which migrates from a low-energy tetrahedral site ( E s ) into a neighboring octahedral site ( E i ) with some activation energy ( E a ) and /uniFB01 nally to a symmetric tetrahedral site.

substitution are often relied upon to guide such substitutions, /uniFB01 rst-principles computation can be used to identify potential doping elements that can be stably substituted into the material and to elucidate the e /uniFB00 ect of dopants on the di /uniFB00 usion behavior (section 4.2). For example, a computational study by He et al. 79 on the oxide-ion conductor Na0.5 Bi 0.5TiO3 (NBT) explored various types of aliovalent cation substitution for A-site Bi 3+ and B-site Ti 4+ in the perovskite structure. Because oxygen ion conduction in the perovskite-structured Na0.5 Bi 0.5TiO3 was mediated by oxygen vacancies, 79,381 a wide range of aliovalent cations with lower valences than Bi 3+ or Ti 4+ , which increase the oxygen vacancy concentration, were computationally evaluated to identify the most energetically favorable dopants (Figure 29c). Multiple dopants with low energy predicted by computation such as Zn, Fe, and Mg on B-sites have been experimentally reported. 79,381 -384 In addition, a number of new aliovalent dopants were predicted to yield NBT perovskite structures with higher oxygen vacancy concentration with acceptable phase stability. Compared with B-site substitution, A-site substitution, such as the substitution of K for Bi, was observed to be particularly e /uniFB00 ective in improving the ionic conductivity while maintaining the phase stability. 79,383 In NBT, although dopant elements with lower valence than the original B-site atom, such as Mg 2+ , create oxygen vacancies, these dopants also increase the oxygen migration barrier owing to the binding between the dopant and created vacancy. The dopant trapping phenomenon has been observed in many types of ion conductors. 385 -388 For example, Toyoura et al. observed that doped W sites trapped interstitial O 2 -ions in the W-doped LaNbO4 oxide-ion conductor, and the authors proposed selecting dopants with smaller association energies, such as Mofor Nb sites, as a solution to suppress this trapping e /uniFB00 ect and improve the ionic conductivity. 386 These e /uniFB00 ects of dopants on ion migration can be evaluated using /uniFB01 rst-principles computation methods including NEB calculations (section 4.2) and AIMD simulations (section 4.3).

## 4.2. Nudged Elastic Band Method

The nudged elastic band (NEB) method implemented in /uniFB01 rstprinciples computation 389,390 is widely used to determine the energy barrier of an ion or atom migrating along a particular pathway in a crystalline structure. A NEB calculation takes the input, such as the initial and /uniFB01 nal migration position of the particular mobile carrier (e.g., Li + vacancy) and an initial guess of the migration pathway and determines the energy landscape along that pathway, the energy of the transition state, and the migration energy barrier ( E a ). In general, a crystalline structure may exhibit multiple ion migration pathways connecting the same or di /uniFB00 erent ion sites, leading to di /uniFB00 erent energy barriers and anisotropic di /uniFB00 usion. The NEB method has contributed signi /uniFB01 cantly to our understanding of atomistic-scale ion migration mechanisms in ion conductors. 143,360 -362,391 -394 For example, Holzwarth and co-workers used NEB calculations to calculate the energy barriers for di /uniFB00 erent defects, such as Li + vacancies and interstitials, migrating along various Li migration pathways in γ -Li3PO4. 395 The authors observed that Li + vacancies migrate in the structure through three pathways starting and ending at low-energy d sites, with barriers between 0.6 and 0.7 eV. For Li + interstitials in γ -Li 3 PO4, direct hopping between interstitial sites was observed to be unfavorable. In contrast, ion hopping via an interstitialcy mechanism, where an interstitial Li-ion replaces a d site lattice ion and that same lattice ion simultaneously migrates to a neighboring interstitial site, was calculated to have the lowest energy barrier of 0.2 -0.35 eV. Given the low migration energy of the interstitialcy mechanism, an increased concentration of Li + interstitials, which can be achieved by preparing a sample with excess Li, is implied to improve the Li + conductivity in γ -Li3PO4. 395

In the study by Shi et al. of Li + di /uniFB00 usion in Li2CO3, 367 a similar comparison between di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 usion mechanisms, such as direct interstitial and correlated interstitialcy hopping, was conducted using the NEB method, following the identi /uniFB01 cation of the dominant charge carrier in the material at a given potential

on the Li-ion battery electrode. Shi et al. also found that the energy barrier for the concerted migration of an interstitial Liion and a lattice Li-ion was substantially lower than that for the direct interstitial hopping mechanism. This computationally identi /uniFB01 ed atomistic mechanism was used to estimate the pro /uniFB01 le of elemental Li in the SEI, which was further con /uniFB01 rmed by experimental measurements of the isotope ratio 6 Li + / 7 Li + in 7 Li + Li 2 CO3 soaked in electrolyte with 6 Li + species. Skjærvø et al. calculated the NEB barrier for O i migration in YMnO3 and calculated an activation energy between 0.48 and 0.62 eV for interstitialcy-mediated di /uniFB00 usion, whereas simple interstitial di /uniFB00 usion had an extremely unfavorable migration barrier of 6 eV. 371 Their calculated energy barrier agreed well with the activation energy of 0.55 ± 0.21 eV estimated in experiments. 371 The interstitialcy mechanism is a type of concerted migration, which has been shown to be a common ion transport mechanism in many fast ion conductors. 80,87,102,396

NEB calculations can be used to compare the energy barriers for di /uniFB00 usion in di /uniFB00 erent materials. 362 Using NEB calculations, Wolverton and co-workers studied Li i + di /uniFB00 usion via direct interstitial hopping in the cathode coatings SiO2, ZrO2, AlF3, MgO, and Al2O3. 368 Although the majority of materials studied exhibited a high migration energy barrier, amorphous AlF 3 and crystalline SiO 2 had low energy barriers for easier Li + di /uniFB00 usion as coating materials. In addition, the NEB method can be used for screening materials with low migration energy barriers. 385,397 Liu and co-workers calculated the voltage, capacity, and stability of spinel oxides composed of a range of transition metals including V, Ti, and Mn, and performed NEB calculations to determine which structures had the potential to exhibit fast ion di /uniFB00 usion with di /uniFB00 erent intercalating ions including Li + , Ca 2+ , and Mg 2+ . 145 They observed that the migration energy barriers varied signi /uniFB01 cantly with the intercalating ion (Figure 30a,b) and proposed Mn2O4 spinels with Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ insertions as promising cathodes for multivalent-ion batteries. The general features of the NEB ion migration pathways can be associated with the changing oxygen ion environment (Figure 30c,d). 144 A combined computational and experimental study later made use of these basic crystal structural principles to tune and optimize the composition of Mg 2+ spinel solid electrolytes and identi /uniFB01 ed several solids with fast Mg 2+ transport at room temperature. 7

## 4.3. Molecular Dynamics Simulation

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations model the dynamics of ions in a material with full atomistic details, a subfemtosecond time resolution, and a simulation time up to the nanosecond level. Thus, MD simulations provide information on ion transport on the time scale of subfemto- to nanoseconds. MD simulations can be categorized into classical MD simulations, which are based on interatomic potentials (aka force /uniFB01 elds) for evaluating atomistic forces, and ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations, in which /uniFB01 rst-principles calculations describe interatomic interactions. Because the interatomic potentials for classical MD simulations may not always be available, especially for newly discovered materials, AIMD simulation, which is chemically agnostic in nature, can be readily applied to any material with complex chemistry. For this reason, AIMD simulation has gained popularity in the past few years for studying ion-conducting materials. 8,37,79,80,143,153,361 Compared with NEB calculations (section 4.2), which require a priori

guesses of migration pathways as input, MD simulations provide a visual of the dynamics and trajectory of ions (Figure 31a), which are directly observed to determine di /uniFB00 usion mechanisms. For example, AIMD simulations by Mo et al. indicated that LGPS was a 3D ion conductor with fast 1D conduction through the c -channels and slower cross-channel ab -planar di /uniFB00 usion, 37 contrary to the early speculation of 1D conduction in LGPS. 6 This prediction was con /uniFB01 rmed by later experiments, which detected Li-ion conduction in both the c and ab directions at room temperature. 335,398,399 By observing the Li-ion di /uniFB00 usion dynamics using AIMD simulations, highly correlated di /uniFB00 usion mechanisms such as concerted migration of multiple ions in the disordered Li sublattice of Li superionic conductor materials, such as LGPS, garnet-structured LLZO, and NASICON LATP, have been revealed. 87,102,396,400,401

The di /uniFB00 usional events of ions that occur during the time interval of an MD simulation can be aggregated and analyzed to quantify the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient and conductivity of mobile ions. The D * of an ion can be quanti /uniFB01 ed from the mean-squared displacement (MSD) of a given mobile ion over a set time interval Δ t :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where d is the dimension of the system. MSD can be given by the following equation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where N is the total number of ions that are di /uniFB00 using and r i ( t ) is the displacement of the i th ion at time t . The evaluation of MSD should be performed over a statistically appropriate ensemble over many possible states of the systems, which are often approximated as a range of states with di /uniFB00 erent starting times with the interval Δ t . 402 In addition, the MSD can be evaluated and averaged for each individual ion, corresponding to the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * (section 2.1) at the time scale of MD simulation. If the MSD is evaluated for the center of mass of all mobile ions, the corresponding D is often called the jump di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient, which is physically similar to and is often regarded as the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D σ , corresponding the collective migration of many ions from macroscopic migration (section 2.1). The ratio between these two di /uniFB00 usivities from MD simulations is often used to estimate the Haven ratio in computation modeling. 80 These di /uniFB00 usional properties are evaluated in the same manner in kinetic Monte Carlo modeling. 403

The ionic conductivity is estimated from the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient using the Nernst -Einstein relation (eq 4). Although eq 4 has been widely used to calculate ionic conductivity, the use of the tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * estimated from individual ion migration would often lead to an underestimation of the ionic conductivity because of the strong correlation of ion migration in fast ion-conductor materials. 80,402,404

Similar to the impedance measurements performed at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures, the ionic conductivity σ of a material can be determined from multiple AIMD simulations at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures. The calculated conductivities yield the following Arrhenius relationship:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

By /uniFB01 tting log( σ T ) vs 1/ T , the activation energy E a and the prefactor σ 0 can be determined. The /uniFB01 tted Arrhenius relation can be used to estimate the ionic conductivity at other temperatures through extrapolation, assuming the di /uniFB00 usion mechanisms are identical at the extrapolated temperatures. Given that many AIMD simulations are performed at temperatures much higher than 300 K (often greater than 600 -1200 K) with a small number of atoms (e.g., a few hundred in total), such an extrapolation may not be quantitatively accurate or physically valid for some materials.

In addition, because the estimation of di /uniFB00 usion properties from MD simulations is based on the statistics of many di /uniFB00 usional events, an appropriate estimation of statistical variance and error bounds is essential. For AIMD simulations, which have a limited number of atoms and a short time duration on the order of a few hundred picoseconds, the total number of di /uniFB00 usional events is highly limited. He et al. systematically tested various parameters in the estimation of di /uniFB00 usional properties from AIMD simulations and proposed a procedure to minimize the errors during the quanti /uniFB01 cation of simulation results. 402 In addition, they proposed a scheme to quantify the statistical variances of di /uniFB00 usional properties, which are directly dependent on the total number of e /uniFB00 ective ion hops during the MD simulation. Therefore, the quantitative evaluation of di /uniFB00 usional properties using AIMD simulations should only be applicable to materials with fast ion conduction and at elevated temperatures. From their estimation for a typical fast ion conductor material, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient from an AIMD simulation may have a relative standard deviation of 20 -50%. Given that the error bounds of di /uniFB00 usional results from AIMD simulations are nonnegligible, an appropriate estimation of error bounds should always be performed and reported.

In addition to the aforementioned di /uniFB00 usional properties, MD simulations reveal additional atomistic information on ion dynamics that is not accessible from NEB calculations. For example, the spatial distribution of mobile-ion movements over time can be aggregated into the probability density of ion occupancy within the crystal structure. The ion probability density can be visualized to reveal di /uniFB00 usional pathways in the structure (Figure 31a). 37 In addition, the ion spatial distribution can be analyzed to determine the ion sites, such as the Li + sites in LGPS (Figure 31b). The unusual distribution of Li-ion sites in the LGPS structure has been noted as a key feature of superionic conductors, which exhibit concerted migration 80 and Li-ion sublattice frustration. 26

The time-evolution information on atoms from MD simulations can be used to estimate the van Hove correlation function to obtain further information on the di /uniFB00 usional mechanisms in a material. The distinct part of the van Hove function indicates the time correlation of the movement of one or more adjacent ions. The van Hove function calculated using AIMD simulations of Li superionic conductors, such as LGPS (Figure 31c), LLZO, and NASICON, indicates that a vacated site becomes occupied within less than 1 ps, which suggests a strong time correlation between consecutive Li + migration events. 80 Such closely correlated hopping of ions is a result of the concerted migration of multiple ions, which has been observed to be a general di /uniFB00 usion mechanism in superionic conductors. 80,87,102,396 As illustrated in these examples, AIMD simulations are particularly advantageous in studying timedependent aspects of ion-migration mechanisms, which are less straightforward to assess using static computation methods including the NEB method.

Because AIMD simulations rely on /uniFB01 rst principles, they can be used to predict novel superionic conductors. A classic example is the study by Ong et al. that aimed to develop a less expensive alternative to LGPS through chemical substitution of the rare and expensive element Ge in the structure. 153 Using /uniFB01 rstprinciples computation with phase stability evaluation (section 4.5), two new stable structures, Li 10SnP2S12 and Li10 SiP2 S12 , were computationally predicted and exhibited high ionic conductivities of 6 and 23 mS cm -1 at 300 K, respectively, as calculated using AIMD simulations (Figure 31d). These predicted structures were the /uniFB01 rst reported alternatives to LGPS composed of more economical and earth-abundant Sn and Si instead of Ge. Moreover, experimental measurements of these materials, synthesized after their prediction, validated the accuracy of the AIMD simulations. Bron et al. measured the room-temperature Li-ion conductivity of Li 10SnP2S12 to be 7 mS cm -1 in the crystalline grain, in excellent agreement with AIMD simulations. 253 By incorporating Cl as a dopant in Li 10 SiP2 S12 , Kato et al. synthesized the superionic conductor Li 9.54 Si 1.74 P1.44 S11.7 Cl0.3 and measured the conductivity to be 25 mS cm -1 at room temperature, 3 which agrees well with the predicted conductivity from computation. Several groups have synthesized other fast-ion conductors in the Li -Si -P-S compositional family, including glass ceramic Li 7SiPS8 and Li 11 Si 2 PS12, with expected room temperature bulk conductivities of approximately 2 mS cm -1 and 7 mS cm -1 , respectively. 178,405 Using AIMD simulations, Richards et al. predicted that the Naion conductor Na10SnP2S12 with the LGPS structure exhibits a room-temperature Na + conductivity of 0.94 mS cm -1 with an activation energy of 0.32 eV. 8 Experimentally synthesized Na10SnP2S12 exhibited a conductivity of 0.4 mS cm -1 at room temperature and an activation energy of 0.356 eV, in excellent agreement with the AIMD simulations. 8 In addition to these selected examples, MD simulations have been successfully used to study and design new Li-ion conductors, 143,291,406 -408 oxideion conductors, 386 hydride-ion conductors, 409 and sodium-ion conductors. 362,410

## 4.4. Materials Stability

Thermodynamic databases and modeling programs are wellestablished tools to guide materials design and selection. 411 -413 Here, we summarize recent advancements in /uniFB01 rst-principles computation for evaluating materials stability. Evaluation of the phase stability of computationally predicted materials is an essential step for continuing further experimental and theoretical studies. 359 -362,414 -416 For a given materials system, a thermodynamic convex hull (Figure 32a) is constructed by comparing the energies of all compounds in the compositional space. Using this convex hull, the phase stability of a given material with composition C can be quanti /uniFB01 ed as the di /uniFB00 erence between its energy E (phase) to the minimum energy of the convex hull E eq (C) at the same composition, which is often a linear combination of ground-state phases on the convex hull. This energy di /uniFB00 erence, E hull (phase), is often called the ' energy above the hull. ' Speci /uniFB01 cally,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For a thermodynamically stable phase, the value of E hull would be zero. For a material with a positive value of E hull (e.g., composition γ in Figure 32a), there is an energetically favorable reaction for the decomposition of the phase into a set of phase equilibria on the convex hull, and the decomposition energy is the negative of E hull . Therefore, the value of E hull represents the thermodynamic driving force for the phase decomposition and can serve as a representation of the phase stability.

Recently, the evaluation of a material ' s phase stability using /uniFB01 rst-principles calculations has been facilitated by databases of theoretical thermodynamic materials data, such as the Materials Project (MP), 415 Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), 41 and Automatic Flow (AFLOW). 416 E hull of a given new material can be determined from DFT calculation of the energy convex hull and phase equilibria directly queried from the materials database. 153,361 This computational approach has been widely adopted in the prediction, design, and discovery of new materials. In the study by Ong et al., the authors evaluated the phase stability of structures in the Li10MP2X12 (M = Ge, Si, Sn; X = O, S) family of materials to /uniFB01 nd less expensive and moisture-stable alternatives to LGPS. 153 The oxides with O-to-S anion substitutions, Li10MP2O12 (M = Ge, Si, Sn), were calculated to have a high E hull greater than 90 meV/atom (Figure 32b), suggesting poor phase stability and synthesizability. In contrast, the Li 10 MP2S12 (M = Ge, Si, Sn) sul /uniFB01 des had relatively low E hull values of 25 meV/atom or less, suggesting good phase stability (Figure 32b). Li 10 SnP2S12, Li 10 SiP2 S12 , and its variant composition Li 10+ x Si 1+ x P2 -x S12 composition have since been successfully synthesized experimentally. 3,178,253,417,418 This approach has been applied to discover and predict an extensive variety of novel ion conductors,

including Li-ion conductors 406,407,419 and novel electrodes for Li-ion batteries, 420,421 oxide-ion conductors, 79 hydride-ion conductors, 409 magnesium-ion conductors, 7 and sodium-ion conductors. 362,422

Currently, the aforementioned evaluation of E hull uses mostly DFT energies from static calculations at 0 K. This is a fair approximation given the di /uniFB00 erences in the PV and TS terms are often small in solid -solid reactions. Monte Carlo modeling based on cluster expansion methods can account for the con /uniFB01 gurational contribution to entropy in a lattice model at elevated temperatures and has been applied to determine the energetics of atomic con /uniFB01 guration (e.g., the lowest energy orderings of a phase) and /uniFB01 nite-temperature properties, such as defect solubility limits, voltage pro /uniFB01 les, or phase diagrams. 363,407,423 -426 In addition, phonon calculations are also widely used to evaluate the vibrational contribution to the free energies. Richards et al. used Monte Carlo modeling based on cluster expansion methods in combination with phonon calculations to produce a /uniFB01 nite-temperature phase diagram for the solubility of Zn in Li 1+2 x Zn1 -x PS4, a newly predicted solid electrolyte. 407 This diagram provided an indication of the experimental feasibility of synthesizing a structure with high Li concentration and high ionic conductivity. Since this work, Li 1+2 x Zn1 -x PS4 has been synthesized and demonstrated successfully as a solid electrolyte for an all-solid-state battery, con /uniFB01 rming the computational prediction results. 427

The limitations of the phase stability calculations should be noted as follows. In addition to the assumption of using static DFT energies at 0 K and the lack of contribution from the TS and PV terms, the accuracy of the phase stability calculation is also a /uniFB00 ected by the accuracy of the DFT energies of all phases in the system; 428 therefore, care must be taken for certain types of materials for which the DFT energy may be inaccurate. Fitting regimes using DFT and DFT+U energies to experimental energies were employed to improve the accuracy in the prediction of formation energies of transition metal oxides and intercalation voltages of conversion electrodes for Li-ion batteries. 429,430 In addition, typical DFT calculations often neglect the e /uniFB00 ects of van der Waals interactions, which are more common in organic molecular compounds or layered materials. 431 -433 The use of DFT functionals including van der Waals interactions or even correction terms results in signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in reproducing the formation energies of layered and molecular materials, 431,432,434 and their use should be considered to improve the accuracy of DFT energies and phase stability predictions. Second, the phase stability evaluation requires the DFT energy of all compounds in the relevant chemical space. 374 In a less-well studied or high-dimension system for which some low-energy compounds are unknown or not included, the evaluation may lead to false-positive predictions of stable phases.

Even with these limitations of DFT calculations, the metastability as assessed using E hull may not be su /uniFB03 cient ascertain the synthesizability of a material but rather is e /uniFB00 ective for ruling out materials with poor synthesizability. Sun et al. summarized the phase stability E hull values for a wide range of materials and proposed that the stability of materials at synthesis conditions plays a central role in the formation of the materials. 435 Their analyses identi /uniFB01 ed many hypothetical polymorphs of well-explored binary oxides with low E hull , but they argued these hypothetical polymorphs were not likely to be synthesized. Therefore, low E hull is not a su /uniFB03 cient criterion for synthesizability and this may explain why some predicted materials with low E hull are di /uniFB03 cult to synthesize. In addition, they proposed that the stability of the intermediate phases under synthesis conditions is key to the formation of the metastable phases. This theory has been supported by many recent theoretical and experimental studies. 436 -441

## 4.5. Comparisons and Limitations of Computational Techniques

As reviewed above, the computational techniques for studying di /uniFB00 usional properties, such as the NEB method, defect calculations, and MD simulations, are highly complementary for understanding various aspects of di /uniFB00 usional mechanisms. The NEB method enables quanti /uniFB01 cation of the migration energy pro /uniFB01 le and barrier for given ion-di /uniFB00 usion pathways within a structure. The di /uniFB00 usional pathway and mobile carriers (e.g., vacancy, interstitial, interstitialcy, or multi-ion complex) are preassigned as input for a NEB calculation. To obtain a full picture of the di /uniFB00 usion mechanism in a material, a range of potential mobile carriers and their formation energies and concentrations should be evaluated and compared (section 4.1) to determine the dominant mobile carrier for di /uniFB00 usion. For the dominant carriers, their corresponding migration pathways (section 4.2) should be comprehensively considered, especially in materials with complex crystal structures. In some materials such as superionic conductors with disordered mobile ion sublattices, a priori guesses of the carriers and their pathways may be challenging.

MD simulations (section 4.3) can greatly complement NEB methods for studying di /uniFB00 usion mechanisms, especially in materials with structural disordering. In MD simulations, the ion hopping is thermally activated, and viable migration pathways will be sampled because of thermal activation. Therefore, MD simulations can be used to model ion di /uniFB00 usion without preassigned di /uniFB00 usional pathways in contrast to the NEB method. MD simulations are particularly advantageous in the study of superionic conductors with a disordered mobile ion sublattice, in which the possible mechanisms of ion migration would be highly diverse and di /uniFB03 cult to guess a priori. For example, recent AIMD simulation studies revealed the concerted migration mechanism of multiple Li ions in Li superionic conductors. 26,80,87,102,396 Such migration modes observed from AIMD simulations were further evaluated by NEB methods for detailed energy pro /uniFB01 les during multi-ion concerted migration to illustrate the di /uniFB00 usional mechanisms. 80,87,102,396

In addition, MD simulations provide di /uniFB00 usional properties and mechanistic information that are not available from other methods because only MD simulations can directly model ion dynamics and di /uniFB00 usional events in real time. The timedependent positions of ions from MD simulations can be used to quantify a large amount of di /uniFB00 usional information, including the jumping rate, site occupancy, spatial probability density of mobile ions, correlation function, and radial distribution functions, 37,80,387,388,402,408 which are crucial atomic-scale details for understanding di /uniFB00 usion mechanisms. In addition, MD simulations can be used to determine the conductivity and di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures, which obey an Arrhenius relationship. This Arrhenius relationship can be used to calculate the activation energy and the prefactor, which comprehensively account for the physical statistical sampling of various ion migration modes in a material. In addition to the activation energy, the importance of the prefactor has been emphasized in a few recent studies. Zeier and co-workers

stressed the coupling between the prefactor and activation energy, also known as the Meyer -Nedel rule, 442 in their study of the conductivity of argyrodites Li6PS5X (X = Cl, Br, I) with di /uniFB00 erent halide anions. 31 They suggested a decrease in the activation energy by increasing the polarizability of the anion sublattice would also decrease the prefactor, leading to only a marginal increase in the conductivity. Di Stefano et al. argued the record room temperature Li + di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient in the new superionic conductor LiTi2(PS4)3 was achieved because of its increased prefactor. 26,443 Therefore, a single parameter, such as the migration barrier or activation energy, is insu /uniFB03 cient for describing the fast ion conduction of a given ion conductor. Among the computational techniques reviewed here, MD simulation is well suited to provide a full set of these di /uniFB00 usional properties including the prefactor in addition to visualization of atomic-scale dynamics.

AIMD simulations have been widely adopted to study ion conductor materials thanks to their capability to be readily applied to new materials with novel structures and chemistries. In contrast, the use of classical MD simulations is often limited by the available choices of interatomic potentials or force /uniFB01 elds. However, AIMD simulations cannot be applied to analyze di /uniFB00 usion in every scenario and are often limited to fast ion conductors at elevated temperatures. 402 AIMD simulations require a signi /uniFB01 cant computational cost and are thus limited to a short physical time (on the order of 100 ps to 1 ns) and a small system size (on the order of a few hundred atoms). However, the accuracy of AIMD simulations in quantifying di /uniFB00 usional properties relies on the comprehensive sampling of a large number of di /uniFB00 usional events observed during the simulation time. Thus, AIMD simulation is generally unsuitable for studying materials with low conductivity and large activation energies because an insu /uniFB03 cient number of ion hops observed during the simulation would lead to erroneous di /uniFB00 usional properties. For the same reason, AIMD simulation is often performed at high temperatures (often 600 K and higher) to increase the number of di /uniFB00 usional events observed. Discrepancies may also arise in cases where the di /uniFB00 usion mechanism at high temperatures is di /uniFB00 erent from that at the temperature of physical interest, for example, in materials that undergo a phase transition or superionic transition between these temperature ranges. Finally, because the estimation of di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient and MSD is a statistical averaging of the stochastic di /uniFB00 usional events that occur during the AIMD simulation, the estimated values from AIMD simulations are subject to statistical variance and error (discussed in section 4.3). 402 Kinetic Monte Carlo method may be an alternative approach to overcome some limitations of AIMD simulations, if a list of fundamental hopping mechanisms can be determined for the materials of interest. 444 -447

Further, AIMD simulations, along with the majority of the atomistic computational methods reviewed here, are most commonly conducted for bulk crystalline structures and are only representative of the di /uniFB00 usion and conductivity in the bulk crystalline phase. A few classical MD simulations have been performed for grain boundaries or amorphous materials. 448 -450 Experimental measurements of the conductivity in polycrystalline materials usually include the bulk and grain-boundary conductivity and any compositional variations or second-phase particles arising from these synthesis conditions, which may be another reason for discrepancy with experimentally determined conductivity values.

## 5. DISCUSSION

## 5.1. Combination of Computational and Experimental Techniques

By combining the strengths of computational and experimental methods, detailed processes of ion transport can be revealed. 208 Taking the heavily studied garnet-structure Li-ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 as an example, traditional powder di /uniFB00 raction combined with the maximum entropy method (MEM) enable depiction of the ion transport process. A continuous 3D moving channel is revealed, and lithium ions migrate in the structure via the 24 d -96 g -48 g -96 h -24 d path, in which the tetrahedral, centered octahedral, and o /uniFB00 -center octahedral sites are all involved. These di /uniFB00 usion phenomena have been further supported by computational studies, 87,396 leading to a concerted lithium-ion transport mechanism similar to the MEM results. In addition to the lithium migration pathways, the activation barrier and Li ionic conductivity were also provided by the computational results. The calculated overall activation barrier for Li di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient from MD simulations in LLZO is 0.33 eV, which is in excellent agreement to the experimental value of 0.30 -0.34 eV. The transport dynamics of lithium in the garnet structure was experimentally con /uniFB01 rmed using 7 Li spin -lattice relaxation NMR spectroscopy. 87,195,451 The jump frequency of lithium was calculated to be 1.9 × 10 5 s -1 at 325 K and 4.9 × 10 8 s -1 at 530 K. In addition, β is 1.7 (smaller than 2), which con /uniFB01 rmed that lithium migration in LLZO is highly correlated.

For the thiophosphate Li 10GeP2S12, the dimensionality of lithium transport was under debate (1D vs 3D). On the basis of synchrotron XRD and neutron di /uniFB00 raction patterns, a 1D lithium-ion conductive channel along the c -axis with an activation barrier of 0.25 eV was determined. 6 This was supported by a follow-up AIMD simulation study, indicating that Li-ion di /uniFB00 usion in 1D channels happens in a string-like fashion. 102 However, MD simulation suggested an anisotropic 3D lithium ionic conduction network: the di /uniFB00 usion channel along the c -axis with activation energy of 0.17 eV, but in the ab plane perpendicular to the c -axis with a higher activation energy of 0.28 eV. 37 Adams et al. proposed a new Li4 (Wycko /uniFB00 4 c ) site, and they believed that the lithium-ion migration in the plane was achieved through the Li4 site located between the channels, which avoids 1D channel blockage, enables 3D lithium-ion di /uniFB00 usion and thus generates excellent ionic conductivity in LGPS. 38 The existence of the Li4 site was later con /uniFB01 rmed by SCXRD of LGPS, followed by con /uniFB01 rmation of lithium motion in a 3D network with comparable activation energy in the ab plane and Li1, Li3 (16 h ) sites, and along the c -axis through Li1 and Li3(16 h ) and Li4 (4 c ) sites. 399 Currently, it is more generally accepted that lithium ions move via a 3D pathway in LGPS rather than a 1D pathway.

Perovskite-type yttrium-doped BaXO3 (X = Zr, Ce) is one group of the most widely studied proton conductors, 452 and various ion transport mechanisms have been proposed based on the /uniFB01 ndings of experimental or computational techniques. The formation of fast proton conduction paths by local lattice softening and the entropic stabilization of proton defects allows BaXO3-based materials to exhibit high proton conductivity. 453,454 The comparison between QENS and DFT results suggests that the movement of hydrogen ions is attributed to proton transfer in octahedra near dopants. 455 QENS and impedance measurements con /uniFB01 rm that the cerium -oxygen and hydroxyl stretching modes propel the protons as charge carriers. 456 By combining EIS, thermogravimetric, and NMR

analysis, Yamazaki et al. demonstrated that in Y-doped BaZrO 3 protons are trapped by the YO6 octahedra and must overcome the association energy of 29 kJ mol -1 between protons and dopants to become trap-free, then move with the migration energy of 16 kJ mol -1 to complete long-range transport. 46 Neutron and X-ray di /uniFB00 raction reveal that protons follow a superstructure organized by yttrium. 286 DFTand kinetic Monte Carlo simulations show that ordered dopant structures can strongly enhance proton conductivity. 287

## 5.2. Classi /uniFB01 cation of Di /uniFB00 usion Coe /uniFB03 cients

Di /uniFB00 usion in crystalline solids occurs via a series of jumps of individual atoms or a group of atoms. The di /uniFB00 usion in a lattice can be expressed by physical quantities that describe the fundamental jump process: the jump distance and jump frequency. Two basic parameters are relevant to ion transport, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient and mobility. The D σ is mobile ion concentration dependent, whereas mobility is not. Self-di /uniFB00 usion is the random translational motion of atoms and is driven by internal kinetic energy in an equilibrium state without external driving force (e.g., electrical /uniFB01 eld). In the study of solid-state ionic conductors, many techniques, including variable-temperature NMR, NMR relaxometry, 2D NMR, QENS, μ + SR, PFG NMRandtracer di /uniFB00 usion, applies no external driving force, thus, the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients obtained from these ways are considered the self-di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient. In this regard, EIS measurement is an exception.

It is worth noting that di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients determined using almost all characterization techniques are averaged, which should, however, in principle vary across di /uniFB00 erent length and time scales. Below, we illustrate the di /uniFB00 erences between di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients. Taking the garnet-structured Li-ion conductor Li7La3Zr2O12 as an example, the lithium ion jump processes from ps to μ s probed using di /uniFB00 erent techniques are presented in Figure 33. Because of technical limitations, only a certain range of jump frequencies can be probed; however, this does not mean that there is only one jump frequency during the process of ion migration. As shown in Figure 33a, during the entire ion transport process, at least three ionic conduction processes are present with di /uniFB00 erent jump frequencies, ranging from kHz to GHz. Moreover, the height of the activation barrier was observed to be negatively correlated to the jump frequency (Figure 33b). For μ + SR, only the very local ionic jump is probed and may not interact with other grains or grain boundaries; therefore, ions only experience a relatively small activation barrier to hop to adjacent sites. In contrast, EIS is sensitive to long-range ion transport, where the grain boundary e /uniFB00 ect is very often present and can lead to a higher activation barrier.

## 5.3. Determination of Activation Energy

The activation barrier can be calculated from the temperaturedependent ionic conductivity measured by EIS. However, we emphasize that the extrapolated activation barriers based on the Arrhenius relationship are di /uniFB00 erent when plotting ln( σ ) vs 1/ T or ln( σ T ) vs 1/ T . For clari /uniFB01 cation, we take the natural logarithm of eq 25 and rearrange it as the following:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Therefore, to calculate the activation barrier, ln( σ T ) should be plotted against 1/ T . As shown in Figure 34, even in a relatively narrow temperature range, the activation barrier di /uniFB00 ers substantially depending on whether temperature is taken into account in the conductivity term.

Figure 33. (a) Schematic illustration of lithium transport process in Li7La3Zr2O12 with di /uniFB00 erent di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient. The heights of the activation barriers are not scaled. The ions in red, green, and blue indicate the motion of ions that can be probed by μ + SR, NMR relaxometry, and EIS measurements, respectively. (b) Di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients and activation barriers of Li in Li7La3Zr2O12 using various techniques. The squares and ( × ) symbols represent the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient and activation barrier, respectively. The symbols in red, green, and blue were probed using NMR relaxometry, μ + SR, and EIS measurements, respectively. All the di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient data were measured at room temperature. Data of activation barrier and di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients are obtained from refs 195,232,270, and 457.

Di /uniFB00 erences of 0.024 and 0.022 eV were observed in LGPS and LAGP when ln( σ ) or ln( σ T) was plotted against 1/ T , respectively.

As we discussed earlier in section 2, this extrapolated activation energy contains information on the defect formation energy for intrinsic defect driven ion migration processes and possibly contains information regarding the defect trapping energy for extrinsic defect driven ion transport processes. We further note that the activation energy deduced from EIS measurement may not be directly comparable to that from MD simulation because they are not on the same time and length scale. This e /uniFB00 ect is also demonstrated in Figure 33; the activation energies probed by di /uniFB00 erent techniques, which are sensitive to di /uniFB00 erent time and length scales, di /uniFB00 er greatly. For the proton conductor Ca-doped LaPO4, 458 QENS measurements revealed an activation barrier of 0.1 eV, whereas a higher value of 1 eV was obtained by EIS measurements. It has been suggested that QENS probes the oscillatory jump of ions between adjacent tetrahedra, whereas EIS probes long-range intertetrahedral di /uniFB00 usion, resulting in di /uniFB00 erent activation barriers corresponding to di /uniFB00 erent ion transport processes.

## 5.4. Estimation of Mobile Ion Concentration

It remains challenging to obtain the exact value of the mobile ion concentration. This has been highlighted in the work by Roling and his co-workers, 459 which suggest that mobile ion concentration should be only discussed when referring to a particular time scale. While considering extremely long time scales (days or years), all carrier ions (e.g., Li + in Li conductors) must be mobile ions; at extremely short time scale, many ions are trapped at equilibrium positions, and as a result, mobile ion concentration must be much smaller than that of carrier ion concentration. Yamazaki et al. elaborated the coexistence of trapped and trap-free protons in Y-doped BaZrO3 proton conductor. 46

By using complementary techniques, di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients at di /uniFB00 erent time scales can be determined. Combining the Nernst -Einstein relation (eq 4) and = * σ H D D R , mobile ion concentration can be estimated by eq 28.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As discussed in section 2.1, for most ionic conductors, the Haven ratio H R is less than or equal to 1. Because the ionic conductivity σ and tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient D * can be directly measured by

EIS and PFG NMR, the maximum mobile ion concentration can be estimated assuming H R equals to 1, which means an uncorrelated transport process. In Table 4, we present some mobile ion concentration of lithium ionic conductors calculated by eq 28, with H R being equal to 1, and compare with their theoretical ion concentration. It can be found that for some ionic conductors, such as Li3N ( c -axis) and Li 7 La3Zr2O12, the mobile ion concentrations were smaller than those estimated from the crystallography parameter (mostly on the order of 10 28 m -3 ). Therefore, care must be taken when estimating the mobile ion concentration on the basis of the crystal structure only. Other techniques also suggested that the assumption of all carrier atoms being mobile is inappropriate. For example, Mori et al. 200 observed a broad peak near the elastic incoherent scattering peak in Li 7 P3S11 , which indicated that not all the Li ions were mobile. Yoshida et al. 460 observed a broad Gaussian peak in 1 H NMR measurements of single-crystal CsHSO4, suggesting that immobile protons were present. On the other hand, the calculated mobile ion concentrations are larger than those estimated from chemical compositions for thio-LISICONs, such as Li 7 GePS8, Li10 GeP2S12, and Li 10 SnP2S12. This suggests that in thio-LISICONs, the Haven ratio HR should be smaller than 1, indicating the strong ion correlations, consistent with current understanding of correlated ion transport in these materials. 80,102

In addition, we also observed that the mobile ion concentration is not always a constant but can be temperature dependent, which in some cases, e.g., in Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO), follows approximately an Arrhenius relationship, as observed in Figure 35. This temperature-dependent behavior of the mobile ion concentration resembles that of defect concentrations, indicating that defects and carriers are most likely correlated in LLZO. We further calculated the slope through linear /uniFB01 tting, which corresponds to an activation energy of 3.88 eV. Intriguingly, this extrapolated activation energy is close to the lithium vacancy formation energy in LLZO (3.6 eV) and is much lower than the lithium interstitial formation energy (5.8 eV), 461 suggesting that the ion transport process of LLZO is likely bene /uniFB01 ted from lithium vacancy formation.

## 5.5. Emerging Experimental Techniques

Using the various techniques developed to date, several physical parameters related to the ion transport process discussed in

Figure 35. Arrhenius plot of mobile ion concentration of LLZO vs 1000/ T . The mobile ion concentrations at di /uniFB00 erent temperatures were calculated from measured di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients from PFG NMR of ref 463 and conductivity from impedance measurements of ref 290.

section 2, including the ionic conductivity, tracer di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient, and corresponding activation energy, can be reliably obtained.

For the jump distance and mobile ion concentration, approximations are often used. The jump distance is often estimated from crystallographic data, such as XRD and neutron di /uniFB00 raction. Alternatively, computational techniques can be used to identify the minimum-energy migration path and thus the jump distance at the same time. Unfortunately, even today, it remains di /uniFB03 cult to precisely measure the mobile ion concentration, which is often assumed to be the total concentration of carrier ions in crystal structure or the defect concentration. However, as discussed earlier, this assumption is most likely incorrect.

Hall e /uniFB00 ect measurements could be an e /uniFB00 ective way to measure the carrier ion concentration and mobility. In semiconductors, the Hall e /uniFB00 ect is often utilized to determine the carrier concentration (electrons and/or holes). When a /uniFB02 ux of charged particles passes through a conducting material in an exerted magnetic /uniFB01 eld, a potential di /uniFB00 erence is generated, expressed by μ μ = | | = | | = | | σ V bE H H H I d I H H H ned , where V H is the Hall voltage being measured, and μ H, b , d , E , H , σ , n , and e are the Hall mobility, sample width, sample thickness, electric /uniFB01 eld, magnetic /uniFB01 eld, conductivity, carrier concentration, and carrier charge, respectively. With the measured Hall voltage and all other known constants, the Hall mobility of the carrier and carrier concentration can be directly derived.

For ionic conductors, Hall e /uniFB00 ect measurements of several fast silver conductors were performed in early research to determine ion transport mechanisms. 465 -467 A study of C5H6NAg5I6 467 suggested the mobile Ag + ion concentrations to be around 5% of all Ag + in the compound, leading to the conclusion that the high conductivity of C5H6NAg5I6 originated from only a small number of mobile ions. Newman et al. 466 measured the Hall mobilities of C5H6NAg5I6, RbAg4I5, and α -AgI and attributed the apparent di /uniFB00 erence between the /uniFB01 rst two ( μ / μ Br ∼ 1.3 × 10 4 , 65) and α -AgI ( μ / μ Br ∼ 1) to their distinct ion transport mechanisms, i.e., a non-Brownian, correlated ' di /uniFB00 usion pipe ' mechanism and random Brownian mechanism, respectively. The ratio μ / μ Br represents the ratio between the sample Hall mobility to that of strictly Brownian motion and is hence indicative of the ion transport mechanism. Liou et al. 468,469 argued that strong correlation e /uniFB00 ects of mobile ions are prerequisites for an ionic Hall voltage to be generated in a crystal. According to previous works, the Hall e /uniFB00 ect may not be observable in ionic conductors associated with uncorrelated ion transport. For recently discovered ionic conductors with strong correlation e /uniFB00 ects during ion transport processes, however, ionic Hall e /uniFB00 ect measurement can be a powerful tool to precisely determine the mobile ion concentration and mobility in these materials.

Migration entropy and attempt frequency are two other physical parameters that are almost impossible to quantitatively measure experimentally. The entropy term is contributed by con /uniFB01 gurational and vibrational entropy, mostly determined by disorder and vibrational frequency of the lattice dynamics, respectively. For example, in Li-ion conductor LGPS the con /uniFB01 gurational entropy term is determined from the partially occupied Li sites and the local disorder of Ge and P.

One potential method to determine the entropy term is to evaluate from the /uniFB01 tting results of EIS. The values of resistance R and nonideal capacitor constant phase element C can be /uniFB01 tted choosing proper equivalent circuit. The parameters of constant phase element C can can be determined via C = Q 1/ n R (1 -n )/ n . Here, Q is a capacitance-like empirical parameter, and n is typically related to the distribution of capacitance values in dielectric structures or the correlation between moving ions. Therefore, the jump frequency ν can be estimated by ν = RC 1 . Taking the natural logarithm of eq 2 and plotting ln ν vs 1/ T , the entropy term can be extrapolated from the intercept assuming an approximated attempt frequency ( ν 0 ) on the order of 10 13 . However, an assumed attempt frequency is a prerequisite for the analysis; thus, the calculated entropy is only an approximation. The attempt frequency is generally considered to be proportional to but not equal to the Debye frequency. From earlier computational results, it appears that the attempt frequency of ion transport in superionic conductors can be as short as the ps level. Therefore, it is necessary to probe the attempt frequency using a technique that can achieve the required temporal resolution of ps. In this regard, the following two techniques can be applied to measure the attempt frequency of ion migration in superionic conductors.

Terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is used to measure the time evolution of terahertz electrical /uniFB01 eld intensity after each terahertz pulse (that is after the interaction of the terahertz pulse with the sample). Fourier transformation can be performed on the time-domain data of terahertz electric /uniFB01 eld intensity vs t to obtain amplitude and phase information of the sample, which can be used to evaluate the THz absorption and conductivity properties. Because the excitation pulse width lies in the picosecond range, THz-TDS is a promising tool to probe ion transport processes in the picosecond range. 470,471 The THz technique has been utilized to investigate carrier dynamics in semiconductors. For instance, using the optical-pump terahertzprobe (OPTP) technique, noncontact photoconductivity measurements of gallium nitride nanowires (NWs) revealed a long conductivity life (&gt;2 ns) and high mobility (820 ± 120 cm 2 (V s) -1 ). 472

In addition to its wide application in characterizing electron transport processes, recently, terahertz spectroscopy has been successfully applied to characterize ion transport in solid electrolytes. 473 In yttria-stabilized zirconia Zr0.84 Y0.16O2 -δ (8YSZ), the basis jump step is considered to be oxygen ions moving to an adjacent unoccupied site (i.e., an oxygen vacancy). However, oxygen vacancies tend to be clustered, thereby

Figure 36. (a) Potential for oxygen vacancy near a dopant atom in an oxide-ion conductor. (b) Conductivity at low (blue) and high temperatures (red). (c) Arrhenius conductivity plot of 8YSZ. The red dots show the temperature dependence of the THz conductivity of 8YSZ at 0.36 THz. The blue dots indicate the low-frequency conductivity in 8YSZ.

substantially a /uniFB00 ecting long-range ion transport. As a result, oxygen ion transport must overcome both the migration energy and binding energy, as indicated by the blue arrow in Figure 36a. The oxygen ion oscillation near the dopant atom (several THz) before the jump occurs can be detected using THz-TDS (yellow arrow in Figure 36a). If the oscillation becomes stronger, the conductivity under 1 THz becomes obvious at high temperature (red line in Figure 36b). As observed in Figure 36b, the yellow shadow area (frequency slightly lower than 1 THz) becomes large as the temperature increases, whereas the conductivity at low frequency barely changes. Therefore, compared with longrange impedance measurement, very di /uniFB00 erent and useful information can be obtained through THz-TDS. When conductivity is plotted vs temperature as shown in Figure 36c, the slope from the impedance measurement is obviously larger than that from the THz-TDS measurement. THz-TDS thus provides a useful way to investigate the ionic conduction process at the ps scale and can be used to separate the ion migration energy from the defect formation energy and defect trapping energy, which are often convoluted together with the migration energy from other measurement techniques. We believe that THz-TDS can be used to study lithium, sodium, and proton conductors, whose attempt frequencies also lie in the terahertz range. With further development of THz-TDS techniques, hidden mechanisms of ion transport that are not accessible by other techniques could be revealed.

Ultrafast optical techniques can be used to characterize the defect and impurity reactions, dissociation, and migration in solid-state materials on the picosecond time scale. These techniques give detailed signals about the rates and pathways of vibrational energy transfer channels as well as the vibrational lifetimes of the local modes. The most common time-resolved method for vibrational lifetime measurements is the pump -probe transient bleaching technique utilizing ultrashort pulses from a tunable infrared laser. These methods also provide new insights into proton transport in solid proton conductors at moderate temperatures. Measurements of the O -H and O -D vibrational lifetimes using a combination of picosecond transient bleaching technique and infrared absorption (IRA) indicate that the room-temperature proton di /uniFB00 usion rate in rutile TiO 2 can be enhanced by 9 orders of magnitude when stimulated by resonant infrared light. The lifetimes measured by picosecond transient bleaching agree well with the measured IR line width. 474 Experimental observation of excited state proton tunneling as a decay channel of the O -H vibrational mode in the perovskite proton-conducting oxide KTaO3 has been reported. The tunneling rate from the excited state was 7 orders of magnitude larger than that from the ground state in the proton conductor BaCeO3. 475

## 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

In this review, we explained in detail the various physical parameters involved in the ionic conduction process as well as the structural parameters that can a /uniFB00 ect these physical parameters. Several confusing aspects in the literature were also elaborated (the activation barrier, di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients, mobile ion concentration, and computed stability of superionic conductors). We reviewed the characterization techniques with respect to ion transport mechanisms both in terms of experiments and computation. The advantages and disadvantages of these techniques were discussed. We analyzed the ion transport process at di /uniFB00 erent time and length scales, and it became apparent that the properties of ion transport (e.g., di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cients and activation barrier) at di /uniFB00 erent length and time scales can be dramatically di /uniFB00 erent in many solid electrolytes. Therefore, a combination of various techniques is required to characterize ion transport in solids.

Using existing techniques, several physical parameters related to ion transport can be accurately measured. However, some physical parameters, which are important for understanding ion transport behavior, have not been accurately measured or even measured at all. A few potential techniques to measure these physical parameters were proposed, such as THz-TDS spectroscopy and ionic Hall e /uniFB00 ect measurement.

Many challenges remain, and substantial room exists for further and deeper understanding of ion transport in crystalline solids including the following:

- (1) Defects are important for ion transport. The nature, location, concentration, and interaction of defects in ionic conductors can all a /uniFB00 ect ion transport to a great extent. How can we understand these aspects better both experimentally and computationally? Once a comprehensive understanding of defects in ionic conductors is developed, the crucial link between defects and carriers must also be established.
- (2) Recently, increasing attention has been focused on the relationship between lattice dynamics and ionic conduction, and it has been proposed that a softer lattice and lower phonon band center are correlated to high ionic conductivity. We believe the next milestone in this /uniFB01 eld is to identify the speci /uniFB01 c phonon modes that control ion transport; by doing so, rational strategies to design fast ionic conductors can be derived.
- (3) As the activation barrier and di /uniFB00 usion coe /uniFB03 cient of ion migration, among other transport-related physical parameters, are time-scale and length-scale dependent, techniques that can cover a wide range of time and length scales need to be combined to yield a relatively complete picture of ion transport processes in crystalline solids. To date, various techniques are available to probe macroscopic ion transport (EIS, PFG NMR, and tracer di /uniFB00 usion measurements) and microscopic ion transport (QENS, NMR, μ + SR, and AIMD). However, we also note that when ion-transport-related physical parameters are discussed, relevant time and length scales should be speci /uniFB01 ed, thus enabling ' apples-to-apples ' comparisons.
- (4) On the computational side, for the future study of di /uniFB00 usion properties, computational insights into the di /uniFB00 usion mechanism beyond that of bulk crystalline phases at larger length scales and longer time scales are highly desired. This requires the development of computational techniques with the versatility, accuracy, and accessibility of ab initio methods but at a fraction of the computational cost. Such modeling methods would be highly bene /uniFB01 cial and can be applied to signi /uniFB01 cantly extend the model size and time period of AIMD simulations and also enable the study of mesoscale materials features such as grain boundaries and interphase layers. 448,449 Recently, computational approaches using machine learning to extend the length scale have been attempted in ionconducting materials. 40,476 -478 Further development in computational modeling capabilities will be essential for improved understanding, computational design, and accelerated discovery of ion conducting materials.

Recently, we have witnessed the rapid development of advanced experimental and computational techniques, which go far beyond the length and time scales that were possible 20 years ago. We hope that the current review can motivate a rethink of the /uniFB01 eld and lead to innovative paths toward a comprehensive understanding of ion transport in crystalline fast ionic conductors.
