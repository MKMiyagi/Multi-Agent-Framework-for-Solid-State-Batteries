ABSTRACT: Benefiting from the advanced solid-state electrolytes (SSEs), conventional cathodes have been widely applied in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). However, Li-rich Mn-based (LRM) cathodes, which possess enhanced discharge capacities beyond 250 mA h g -1 , have not yet been studied in ASSLBs. In this work, the practical application of LRM cathodes in ASSLBs using a highvoltage-stability halide SSE (Li 3 InCl6, LIC) is reported for the first time. Furthermore, we decipher that the active oxygen released from LRM cathodes at a high operation voltage seriously oxidizes the LIC electrolytes, thus resulting in the large interfacial resistance between cathodes and electrolytes and hindering their industrialized application in ASSLBs. Therefore, surface chemistry engineering of LRM cathodes with an ionic conductive coating material of LiNbO3 (LNO) is employed to stabilize the LRM/LIC interface. Consequently, the LRM-based ASSLBs deliver a high specific capacity of 221 mA h g -1 at 0.1 C and a decent cycle

## 1. INTRODUCTION

All-solid-state lithium batteries, using nonflammable SSEs, are expected to fundamentally address safety problems in liquid lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). 1 With the development of several advanced SSEs with high ionic conductivity, especially sulfidebased electrolytes, 2 some conventional cathodes such as LiFePO4, 3 Ni-rich materials, 4 and LiCoO2 5 have already been successfully applied in ASSLBs. However, Li-rich Mnbased (LRM) layered oxide cathodes, which are the most attractive cathode to achieve the goal of 350 W h kg -1 in LIBs, 6,7 have rarely been studied in ASSLBs. Although some special interfacial behaviors have been reported, 8 the actual electrochemical performance of LRM-based ASSLBs is still blank so far. Based on our understanding, two challenges impede their practical application.

On the one hand, it is challenging to develop perfectly suitable SSEs that possess a wide electrochemical window and high ionic conductivity simultaneously to match the significantly high charging voltage (up to 4.8 V) of LRM cathodes. According to previous studies, the ionic conductivities of some sulfide electrolytes exceed 10 -3 S cm -1 but begin to suffer from oxidative decomposition at the cathode sides even at relatively lower voltages. Examples include Li3PS4 (LPS) at 2.41 V 9 and

Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) at 2.15 V. 10 Fortunately, according to recent theoretical and experimental results, some halide SSEs are expected to have promising application prospects due to their wide and stable electrochemical windows and relatively high ionic conductivities at room temperature. 11 Remarkably, the ionic conductivity of the water-mediated synthesized Li 3InCl6 (LIC) SSEs reaches as high as 2.04 × 10 -3 S cm -1 at 25 ° C. 12 Meanwhile, the LIC SSE is demonstrated to be chemically and electrochemically stable toward the oxide cathodes even when charged to high voltages. 12 The good performance of the ASSLBs utilizing LIC SSEs with NMC811 cathodes displays a reversible discharge capacity of 154 mA h g -1 , suggesting that LIC is an up-and-coming SSE candidate for practical applications. Moreover, compared to some sulfide electrolytes, LIC SSEs present unique advantages in avoiding side reactions with oxide cathode materials. For example, the

space charge layer is a common interface reaction in sulfidebased ASSLBs that consumes lithium ions when the battery is charged for the first cycle and therefore limits the capacity of oxide cathode materials to a great extent. 13 It is usually necessary to introduce a coating layer to suppress this phenomenon, which increases the manufacturing cost and difficulty of sulfide-based ASSLBs. However, for halide electrolytes, when matched with oxide cathode materials, there is great chemical and electrochemical stability at the cathode/electrolyte interfaces. Wang et al. reported the in situ interfacial synthesis of LIC on the surface of LiCoO2 to improve the solid-to-solid contact and interfacial ionic conductivity between LIC and LiCoO2. 14 The initial discharge capacity of the coated cathodes is 131.7 mA h g -1 at 0.1 C, corresponding to the initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.7%. This result suggests that the LIC electrolyte has good electrochemical stability toward LiCoO2 cathodes even charged to 4.2 V. The good stability toward oxide cathodes and wide electrochemical stability window of LIC indicate the possibility of applying LRM materials in ASSLBs with this advanced halide electrolyte.

On the other hand, the high capacities of the LRM materials result from the lattice oxygen redox reaction of the Li2MnO3 phase. 15 However, the activation of Li2MnO3 and oxygen redox reaction lead to lattice oxygen loss and structural transformation. 16 These factors cause severe unexpected problems, such as electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactions, and result in the rapid capacity degradation of the batteries. 17 Moreover, even though the electrochemical window of halide electrolytes is much higher than that of sulfide electrolytes, according to our research, when in direct contact with LRM cathodes, the LIC electrolytes still undergo serious oxidative decomposition at high voltages. This is similar to the degradation of sulfide electrolytes constrainedly matched

with LiCoO2 and Ni-rich cathodes. 18 Therefore, artificial coating layers applied between the SSEs and cathodes are necessary to avoid unexpected side reactions and protect the SSEs from further decomposition. 19 According to previous research studies, some electrochemically stable coating layer materials such as LiTaO3, 20 LiNbO3, 21 and Li3PO4 22,23 play essential roles in reducing the cathode/electrolyte interfacial resistance in ASSLBs.

In this work, LIC is selected as the SSE due to its higher voltage stability than sulfide-based SSEs and decent ionic conductivity. The interfacial resistance and oxygen-redox- induced structural degradation at the LRM/LIC interface are investigated by in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (in situ EIS), accompanied by the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) method, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). To restrain the LRM/LIC interface degradation, LiNbO3 (LNO), as an ionic conductive coating material, is constructed on the surface of LRM cathodes, which boosts the electrochemical performance of the LRM-based ASSLBs. Encouragingly, the discharge capacity of the LRM-based ASSLBs reaches 221 mA h g -1 at 0.1 C. Even at a high rate of 2 C, the capacity maintains 78 mA

h g -1 , much higher than that of conventional layered oxide cathodes reported in halide-based ASSLBs to our reference knowledge.

## 2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1. Material Characterization. The ionic conductivity of LIC electrolytes is particularly important for the properties of ASSLBs. Figure S1a shows the Nyquist plot of the LIC electrolytes at room temperature. As expected, the LIC SSEs exhibit a high ionic conductivity of approximately 1.8 × 10 -3 S cm -1 at 25 ° C, which is capable of practical application. 12 The accurate onset voltage for LIC oxidation is determined by conducting linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements with a Super P (SP) | LIC | Li cell. As shown in Figure S1b, below 4.1 V, the current increases extremely slightly with the increasing voltage. The abrupt current rise appears at 4.1 V, which indicates that the oxidation of LIC electrolytes starts at approximately 4.1 V, which is much higher than that of some sulfide electrolytes, 24 demonstrating that the LIC electrolytes can be used for some high-voltage cathodes.

The crystal structures of the pristine LRM and 1.5 wt % LNO-coated LRM (LNO-LRM) samples are investigated through X-ray diffraction (XRD). Both samples in Figure S3 can be indexed to the hexagonal structure of α -NaFeO2 ( R -3 m ). The peaks between 18 and 36 ° (Figure S3b) are the superlattice structures of Li and Mn in Li2MnO3 (monoclinic structure, space group C 2/ m ). 25 The diffraction peaks of (018)/(110) and (006)/(012) explain that the surface-coated samples have the same layered structure compared with the pristine samples. Additionally, the I (003)/ I (104) values, which are related to the cation mixed degree in the LRM cathodes, 26 of the pristine LRM and LNO-LRM samples are 2.23 and 2.15, respectively, implying that the LNO coating layer has no significant influence on the layered structure of LRM materials. Moreover, Rietveld refinements of the XRD pattern for both samples (Figure S3c,d) are successfully obtained by FullProf based on the R -3 m model. The resulting lattice parameters of the bare LRM cathodes ( a = 2.860039 Å, c = 14.247820 Å) and LNO-LRM ( a = 2.860203 Å, c = 14.247866 Å) are extremely identical, which further suggests that the LNO layer has no negative influence on the structure of the LRM materials.

To gain more structural insights into the materials, the pristine LRM and LNO-LRM samples are analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). As shown in Figure 1a, the pristine LRM cathodes exhibit the typical morphology with a particle size of 8 -10 μ m. After coating with LNO, the surface of the samples appears rougher (Figure 1c). The lattice fringes of the pristine LRM materials are clearly displayed in Figure 1b, with a d -spacing of 0.475 nm, and no other layers can be observed on the bare LRM materials. Additionally, fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns further demonstrate that the bare LRM cathodes possess the characteristics of the layered structure in Li-rich materials. These findings correspond to the XRD patterns. In contrast, there is an approximately 5 nm amorphous coating layer on the LNO-LRM samples (Figure 1d), which corresponds to the LiNbO3 coating materials. Moreover, the scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM -EDX) shown in Figure 1e -i also demonstrates the uniform distribution of the Nb element on the LNO-LRM particles. In addition, the signal from Nb at 207.25 eV is detected in XPS

(Figure S4), indicating its 5+ oxidation, 27 further confirming the LNO coating layer on the surface of LRM cathodes. These results indicate that the LNO layer has been successfully coated on the LRM particles and has no influence on the bulk structure of LRM cathode materials.

2.2. Electrochemical Performance. The electrochemical performance of pristine LRM is evaluated in LIBs, halide-based (LIC), and sulfide-based (LGPS) ASSLBs. Figure 2a reveals the initial charge -discharge profiles of LRM cathodes at 0.1 C (1 C = 200 mA g -1 ) in different batteries, and the particular values can be seen in Table S1. In the conventional LIBs, the specific initial charge and discharge capacities of LRM reach 311.2 and 235.3 mA h g -1 . In contrast, in sulfide-based ASSLBs, the initial charge and discharge capacities are only 104.5 and 41.5 mA h g -1 , which are far lower than the normal level. In halide-based ASSLBs, the initial charge capacity of the bare LRM cathodes is 312 mA h g -1 , which compares favorably with the capacity of LIBs. However, the discharge capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency are lower than those of LIBs. On the other hand, the discharge capacity of the pristine LRM in LIC-based ASSLBs drops rapidly (Figure S5), indicating the unstable electrochemical properties during cycling. These results reveal that the LRM materials have excellent prospects for research and application in halide-based ASSLBs. However, there are two main problems that need to be solved in this project: (1) the initial discharge specific capacity is lower than the normal level; (2) the poor cycling stability dramatically limits the practical application of LRM cathodes in ASSLBs.

According to the literature, the main reason for the capacity degradation of different ASSLBs is usually concentrated on the chemical or electrochemical reactions at the cathode/electrolyte interface, such as the space charge effect and the mutual diffusion of elements. 5,28 In previous studies, LiNbO3 was demonstrated to be profitable in preventing the interface reaction between cathode materials (such as LCoO2 and NCM811) and sulfide electrolytes, and the synthesis method of this coating layer is relatively simple and efficient. 22,29 Therefore, the LiNbO3 interface layer is employed in this work to inhibit the interface reaction to improve the electrochemical performance of the halide-based ASSLBs. The results of different coating ratios are shown in Figure 2. Compared with the uncoated LRM material, the initial charge capacities of the LNO-coated LRM cathodes with different coating ratios decrease slightly (Figure 2b), which is mainly caused by the amorphous LNO coating layers. Besides, the initial discharge capacities of the LNO-coated LRM cathodes increase observably, among which the cathodes with 1.5 wt % LNO coating layer provide the best discharge capacity of 221 mA h g -1 at 0.1 C, and the corresponding Coulombic efficiency increases to 73.21% (compared with 58.79% of the pristine LRM). More importantly, the 1.5 wt % LNO-LRM cathodes display improved cycling stability compared to the pristine LRM materials (Figures 2c and S6). After 100 cycles, the discharge specific capacity remains 110 mA h g -1 , which is far more than that of the pristine LRM cathodes. Figure 2d,e shows the rate performance of the pristine LRM and 1.5 wt % LNO-LRM cathodes. The discharge specific capacity of the 1.5 wt % LNO-LRM cathode is still maintained at 101.5 mA h g -1 at 1 C, which is much higher than 60.7 mA h g -1 of the pristine LRM. From the electrochemical performance, we can conclude that constructing a coating layer with an appropriate ratio and

thickness on LRM cathodes is a prerequisite to improve the specific capacity and cycling performance.

2.3. Interface Analysis. The chemical and electrochemical characteristics at the cathode/electrolyte interface ordinarily introduce some side products in the ASSLBs, which is primarily responsible for capacity decay. 30 Therefore, it is imperative to explore the chemical and electrochemical stability of the interface between the LRM cathodes and LIC electrolytes. First, EIS tests of uncharged batteries with different resting times are carried out. In Figure S7 and Table S2, the intercept on the X -axis represents the internal electrolyte resistance ( R s ), the value of the semicircle diameter represents the charge transfer resistance ( R ct) at the LRM/LIC interface, and the straight line represents the diffusion of lithium ions of the ASSLBs. 31 The assembled LRM/LIC/In cells exhibit a small R ct before electrochemical cycling, and the value of R ct increases negligibly with the prolonged resting time, indicating good electrical conductivity at the LRM/LIC interface. To further verify the chemical stability between the LRM cathodes and LIC electrolytes, XPS is carried out on the cathode side of the batteries. As shown in Figure S8, after resting for 100 h, there is no change in the peak shape and position of Cl 2p, In 3d, and O 1s of the mixed LRM/LIC composite electrodes, 32 and the peak of lattice oxygen O 2 -of the LRM material is clearly visible, 33 indicating that the LRM cathodes and the LIC electrolytes are chemically stable. Through the EIS and XPS tests, the chemical stability between LRM and LIC electrolytes can be confirmed.

To explore the reasons for low capacities and Coulombic efficiency of the bare LRM cathodes, in situ EIS tests are performed on the battery during the first cycle. Figure 3 displays the impedance variation during the first charge -discharge process. Since the impedance spectra obtained from the test are severely overlapped, which makes the correspond- ing impedance spectra analysis difficult, we introduce the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) method to analyze the change of interface impedance between LRM/LIC. The DRT analysis method is an EIS analysis technique that does not depend on prior knowledge of the research subjects and can be used to separate and resolve the highly overlapping physicochemical processes in EIS. 34 In Figure 3b, four regions can be divided during the discharge process, labeled C1, C2, C3, and C4. The C1 peak at ultrahigh frequencies corresponds to the contact resistance within electrode particles and interfaces between current collectors and electrodes. 35 The C2 and C3 peaks correspond to the ion transport at the anode and cathode interfaces, respectively. At the position of the longest relaxation time, C4 peaks represent the solid-phase diffusion of the LRM cathodes. The C1 peaks remain almost unchanged during the charge process, demonstrating the close contact between particles. The C3 peaks move to the lower frequencies during the charging process, and the intensities constantly increase during the charging process. Similarly, four regions can also be monitored in the discharging DRT results (Figure 3d). Unlike their counterparts in the charging process, the D3 peaks decrease gradually during the discharging process, which is opposite to the charging process. Then, the D3 peaks remain stalely at the end of the discharging process. The area of the peak usually reflects the magnitude of the impedance. 34 The areas of D3 peaks, which correspond to the cathode/electrolyte interface impedance, remain at a high level in the terminal discharging process, suggesting that the increase of cathode/electrolyte interface impedance is irreversible. From the DRT results, the interface resistance on the cathode side undergoes a significant change under different open-circuit voltages (OCVs). The LRM/LIC interface resistance increases greatly during the first cycle, and this increase in resistance is irreversible in the subsequent

(d) In K-edge XAS spectra and (e) In K-edge EXAFS spectra of pristine LRM/LIC, LRM/LIC after 100 cycles, LNO-LRM/LIC before cycling, and LNO-LRM/LIC after 100 cycles.

discharge process. Compared with the pristine LRM and LIC, the EIS tests for the interface between the 1.5 wt % LNO-LRM and LIC show a much lower resistance (Figure 3e -h). The DRT analysis further confirms this conclusion. The C3 peaks increase slightly during the charging process, and the areas of the D3 peaks remain at a relative lower level than the interface resistance of pristine LRM and LIC.

According to EIS variation, when the battery is charged up to a specific voltage, some interfacial reactions occur at the cathode/electrolyte interface, resulting in the formation of some side products with high impedance. To further explore the specific reactions at the interface, XPS is performed on the cathode side of the ASSLBs at different charging voltages. For LIC electrolytes (Figure 4a), with the increase of the charging voltage, the characteristic peaks of In 3d at the binding energy of 453.3 eV and 445.7 eV 14 gradually weaken. A pair of new peaks appear at 450.5 and 443 eV, which correspond to the characteristic peaks of In 2O3, 36 and the peak intensity gradually increases with the higher charging voltages, indicating that the side products of In2O3 are formed by the electrochemical oxidation of LIC under high voltage. The experimental process is carried out in a vacuum environment, and the electrolyte does not contain the O element. Therefore, the O 1s spectra of LRM cathodes in the XPS results are analyzed (Figure 4b). For LRM materials, alongside the increasing voltage, the lattice oxygen O 2 -with the characteristic peaks at 529.5 eV gradually weakens, and a new peak appears at 530.5 eV in the spectra. According to the literature, this is due to the insufficient electronic coordination of oxygen atoms. 7 The peak at 530.5 eV is related to the formation of O2 2 -lattice oxygen with a lower electron density. 7,33 This O2 2 -lattice oxygen is extremely unstable and easy to react with LIC electrolytes, which explains well the formation of In2O3 under high voltage in the In 3d spectra. When the battery is charged to 4.8 V, the peaks of O 2 -and O2 2 -are both weakened, while the characteristic peaks of the corresponding electrolyte oxidation products at 533 and 531.5 eV are obviously dominant. According to the In 3d spectra, the characteristic peak of In2O3 is ascendant at 4.8 V. It can be concluded that when the battery is charged to 4.8 V, the lattice oxygen O 2 2 -with high reactivity is violently reacted with the LIC electrolyte, leading to the oxidation of the LIC electrolytes. This also explains the increase in LRM/LIC interface impedance at a high voltage in the EIS test. To explore the reasons for the poor cycle stability of the ASSLBs, XRD is employed to analyze the composite electrodes before and after 100 cycles, as shown in Figure S9. For the cycled electrolyte, all the characteristic peaks of LIC at 14.5, 28, 29.4, and 34 ° weaken or disappear, 11,12 indicating that the LIC electrolytes have been seriously oxidized and decomposed during cycling at high voltages, and the decomposition products increasingly accumulate at the cathode/electrolyte interface, deteriorating the increase of interface impedance and rapid decrease of capacities. Different from the pristine LRM cathodes, after being coated with LNO, the characteristic peaks of LIC (Figure 4c) at 453.3 and 445.7 eV (corresponding to the In 3+ bonding state of LIC) 14 do not shift with the increasing charge voltages, and no characteristic peak of In 2 O3 appears even at extremely high voltages. For the O 1s spectra (Figure 4d), when the charging voltage rises to 4.8 V, the characteristic peak of lattice oxygen O 2 2 -at 530.5 eV can be clearly observed, indicating that the lattice oxygen O 2 -is still partially transformed into O2 2 -at high voltages. However, the LNO interface coating layer with high stability prevents the direct contact between LRM and LIC, so that O2 2 -has no oxidative influence on the LIC electrolytes.

SEM and TEM are performed on the pristine and cycled LRM electrodes to visualize the structural changes of the cycled cathode materials. As shown in Figure S10, the LRM cathode particles are complete and flat before cycling, and the electrodes keep a close contact between LRM particles and

LIC electrolytes. After cycling, some cracks in the LIC electrolytes can be clearly observed, and oxidation decomposition products completely cover the surface of LRM particles. In Figure 5a, the TEM images reveal that the surface of LRM particles before cycling is highly smooth, and the layered structure is clearly visible, which coincides with the structural characteristics of Li-rich layered materials. For the cycled LRM cathodes, the particle surface is grooved and unevenly covered with amorphous impurities. Moreover, the LRM materials undergo a severe phase reconstruction from layered to rock-salt structures, indicating that the release of lattice oxygen results in interfacial structure degradation. 37 It can be concluded that the LIC electrolyte is oxidized and decomposed during the long cycles, and the decomposition products are wrapped on the surface of LRM particles, which impedes the transmission of lithium ions. In addition, the layered phase structure of the cycled LRM material is seriously damaged, and the generated rock-salt phase further hinders the interfacial Li + transport between LRM and LIC. Both the electrolytes' oxidative decomposition and cathodes' structural changes result in the rapid decrease of capacities. On the contrary, the crystal structure of the cycled LNO-LRM materials can be observed in Figure 5c. The surface of the LNO-LRM materials is still covered with amorphous LNO materials, indicating that the LNO coating layer has not been destroyed after the long cycling process. Furthermore, the coated samples show smooth morphological characteristics, which differ from those of the cycled LRM with groove-like morphology. For the surface of the LNO-LRM particles, the layered phase still transforms into the rock-salt phase, indicating that the extraction of lattice oxygen still occurs during the long cycling life.

Moreover, XAS is carried out to further decipher the local structure change of the LIC electrolytes after cycling (Figure 5d). The In K-edge of the cycled LRM/LIC electrodes moves to the higher energy when compared with t pristine LRM/LIC electrodes, indicating the changes in the surrounding structure of In 3+ and oxidation of the LIC electrolyte. 38 With the LNO coating, In misregistration is negligible before and after cycling, indicating that the LNO coating layer is beneficial in protecting the LIC electrolytes from being oxidized and degraded. Besides, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is performed, and the corresponding spectra are shown in Figure 5e. The peaks at approximately 1.5 Å correspond to the In -O shell, 39 and the peaks at 2.1 Å correspond to the In -Cl shell. 38 Comparatively, the intensity of the first peak of the cycled LRM/LIC electrodes emerges obviously, which explains well the formation of In -O bonds. For the cycled LNO-LRM/LIC electrode, the In -O bonds are also observed, but the amplitude of this peak is much lower than that of the LRM/ LIC samples. All the findings are fully consistent with the TEM and XPS results. The release of O2 2 -has oxidative effects on LIC electrolytes. Fortunately, the LNO coating layer can comparatively restrain the direct contact between the LRM cathodes and LIC electrolytes to prevent the LIC electrolytes from severe decomposition.

## 3. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, the LRM material has been successfully applied in halide-based ASSLBs with the LIC electrolytes, and the unique interfacial reaction between LRM cathodes and LIC electrolytes is deciphered for the first time. At high voltages, the lattice oxygen O 2 -from LRM transforms into O2 2 -with strong oxidation properties and reacts with the LIC electrolyte directly to form In2O3 at the interface, thus greatly exacerbating the interfacial impedance and limiting the electrochemical performance of LRM cathodes. In addition, the release of lattice oxygen makes the LRM materials undergo an irreversible phase reconstruction from a layered phase to a rock-salt phase, which hinders the conduction of Li + and further deteriorates the cycling performance of the ASSLBs. To address these issues, an interfacial layer of LNO is constructed on the surface of LRM cathodes, which significantly inhibits the reaction between the lattice oxygen O2 2 -and LIC electrolytes. As a result, the LRM-based ASSLBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 221 mA h g -1 at 0.1 C and a decent capacity of 110 mA h g -1 after 100 cycles. This ASSLB design provides researchers an important reference and great confidence for further future investigation of LRM in ASSLBs. There are still many topics that have to be studied before the industrialization of LRM in ASSLBs, such as the voltage decay of LRM cathodes during cycling, which are the directions of our further research and will be explored more deeply in the subsequent works.
