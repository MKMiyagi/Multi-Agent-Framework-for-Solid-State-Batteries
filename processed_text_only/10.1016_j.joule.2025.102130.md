CONTEXT &amp; SCALE All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) potentially offer a higher energy density and improved safety relative to liquid-electrolyte systems, but progress depends on solid electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and good compatibility with composite cathodes. To address the lithium resource limits, sodium chemistries are attractive, yet sodium solid electrolytes show limited room-temperature ionic conductivity. This work combines computational and experimental data to evaluate the metastability of a sodium hydridoborate and show that rapid cooling from the crystallization regime kinetically locks the orthorhombic phase with fast Na + mobility. When paired with a chloride-based solid-electrolyte-coated cathode, this metastable phase enables thick, high-areal-loading composite cathodes that retain performance down to subzero temperatures. Because the underlying principle is kinetic stabilization of a diffusion-favorable anion framework, this approach is transferable to related hydridoborates and other anion-cluster chemistries. This work provides a practical design strategy and processing guidelines for high-performing solid electrolytes.

## SUMMARY

All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) featuring a thick cathode layer paired with a high-capacity alloy anode offer enhanced energy density and reliable performance, even at subzero temperatures, and can outperform their liquid-based counterparts. Enabling such technology requires a solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, mechanical formability, and excellent electrochemical stability. Here, we demonstrate that a kinetically stable orthorhombic Na3(B12H12)(BH4) phase exhibits a superionic conductivity of 4.6 mS cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 at 30 ◦ C alongside excellent reduction stability. High-throughput molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the propensity for anion motion significantly enhances the population of highly mobile Na + without affecting the activation energy. By leveraging its high conductivity across a wide temperature range, this material enables the development of all-solid-state sodium-ion batteries with ultra-thick cathodes, delivering reliable functionality at room temperature and in subzero environments. This study expands our understanding of hydridoborate-based solid electrolytes, highlighting their potential in next-generation energy storage systems.

## INTRODUCTION

All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs), with a solid electrolyte replacing the liquid electrolyte in conventional batteries, have attracted considerable attention in academia and industry because of their promising intrinsic  characteristics,  including  enhanced  safety, longer life cycle, and high energy density. 1,2 While lithium-based batteries remain the dominant technology, sodium-based ASSBs are a complementary, safe, and cost-effective alternative chemistry owing to the abundance and cost of sodium. 3,4 The

general rule in the selection of optimal solid electrolytes depends on  several  factors:  ionic  conductivity,  electrochemical  and chemical stability, and mechanical properties. 5,6

Owing to poor sodium diffusivity and high Young's modulus of oxide cathodes, a solid electrolyte must be integrated with the active material to provide ionic percolation in the electrode layer. Thus, solid electrolytes must possess low modulus to conform effectively to the cathode while preserving the intimate contact between  the  materials  during  repeated  electrochemical  reactions. For the ASSBs to displace conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, a thick and dense cathode, along with the use of a high-capacity alloy anode, is necessary to enhance the energy density  at  the  cell  level. 2,7 Accordingly,  a  highly  conductive (&gt;mS cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 ) solid electrolyte is highly sought after to minimize ohmic resistance and polarization in battery cells.

Sodium hydridoborates are promising solid electrolytes owing to their low density ( ∼ 1.2 g cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 3 ), low toxicity, excellent reduction stability, and moderately soft mechanical properties, which enable densification at room temperature. 8-12 Reports show that incorporating mixed alio- or isovalent anions compounds can stabilize  the  high-symmetry  polymorph  (Table  S1),  leading  to superionic  conductivity  at  room  temperature. 13-19 While  the highly symmetric anion structure supports long-range Na + diffusion, its regular coordination sites create a large energy gap that hinders Na + migration. 20,21 In contrast, lowering the anion-lattice symmetry creates irregular coordination environment, reducing energy barriers and enhancing ionic conductivity. 22,23

Despite  these  potential  benefits,  the  orthorhombic  sodium closo-hydridoborate  with Cmc 21 symmetry  (o-NBH,  with  a chemical composition of Na3(B12H12)(BH4)) (Figure 1A) exhibits one order of magnitude lower room-temperature ionic conductivity,  compared  with  phases  where  the  anions  retain  a  highsymmetry  backbone. 24 The  uncertain  thermostability  of  the o-NBH at room temperature may lead to degradation or phase transitions, potentially reducing the purity of the synthesized material. In this work, we combine experimental and computational approaches  to  demonstrate  that  metastable  o-NBH  exhibits superionic conductivity, reaching 4.6 mS cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 at 30 ◦ C. This material  facilitates  the  development of ASSBs with an ultra-thick cathode (approximately 310 μ m), which deliver reliable capacity not only at room temperature but also in subzero environments.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

## Synthesis and structure analysis

The phase diagrams of Na-B-H in Figure 1B, derived from highly accurate high-throughput density function theory (DFT) calculations (see methods), suggest that o-NBH is not thermodynamically stable with energy above hull of 16 meV atom GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 at 300 K, but it is entropically stabilized at temperatures above 650 K. Differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  and  synchrotron  X-ray diffraction  (s-XRD)  patterns  were  collected  to  determine  the phase  evolution  with  temperature.  DSC  and in  situ XRD  in Figures S1A and S1B, respectively, show that the formation of the  o-NBH phase begins at approximately 360 ◦ C and is fully formed at 400 ◦ C. After the formation of o-NBH, rapid cooling of the material by quenching the glass capillary in 25 ◦ C water leads to only the o-NBH phase without any observable precursor reflections (Figures 1C and S1C). However, a slow cooling rate (0.5 ◦ C min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 )  from 400 ◦ C to room temperature leads to a mixture

ters are mixed into a single phase at the atomic  scale  comes  from  two-dimensional 1 H- 1 H  dipolar-coupling-mediated spin-exchange spectra (Figure S2), which shows strong correlations even at millisecond  mixing  times.  Of  great  utility  is that the distinct chemical shifts of 11 BH4 in o-NBH vs. NaBH4  allow us to directly estimate the fraction of the o-NBH phase to be 90 atom % when quenched vs. 61 atom % when cooled at 2 ◦ C min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 .

Additionally, 23 Na NMR spectra (Figure 2B) indicates the existence of two distinct sodium environments in o-NBH-2, which match NaBH4 and Na2B12H12 at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 7.8 and GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 12.1  ppm,  respectively.  On  the  other hand,  o-NBH-Q  shows  a  single  resonance centered at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 11.2 ppm, indicating that  there  is  a  chemical  exchange  and shift averaging between the two environments, 27 which  is  expected  in  the  pro- of Na2B12H12 and NaBH4, implying that o-NBH is a metastable phase that dissociates into its enthalpy-preferred precursors if given sufficient energy and time.

The local environments of the materials prepared with different cooling rates (denoted o-NBH-2 and o-NBH-Q with 2 ◦ C min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 cooling  and  quenching  of  o-NBH,  respectively)  were  further probed using 11 B, 1 H,  and 23 Na solid-state  nuclear  magnetic resonance  (ss-NMR)  spectroscopy.  The 11 B  ss-NMR  spectra of Na2B12H12 and NaBH4 in Figure 2A each exhibits a single resonance with chemical shifts of GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 16.3 and GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 42.1 ppm, respectively. 25,26 o-NBH-Q  has  two  resonances  centered  at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 15.5 and GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 44.3 ppm, which are attributed to boron in B12H12  and BH4  clusters, respectively. The similarity between 11 B spectra in the precursors and o-NBH phase suggests that the B12H12 and  BH4  clusters  are  maintained  after  thermal  treatment  but with differentiated neighboring sodium distributions. The more negative chemical shift of 11 BH4  in o-NBH ( GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 44.3 ppm) vs. in NaBH4  ( GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 42.1 ppm) is attributed  to  electron  density  donated by the additional Na + from the Na2B12H12  component around the more localized (harder) BH4  group in the o-NBH structure. Consequently, the 11 B12H12  exhibits a more positive chemical shift  from GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 16.3 to GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 15.5 ppm. This hypothesis is supported by Cambridge Serial Total Energy Package (CASTEP) calculations (Table S2). Strong evidence that the B12H12 and BH4 clus- posed structure model featuring neighboring B12H12  and BH4 clusters with rapid Na + dynamics. The 23 Na line shapes thus support the metastable nature of the o-NBH phase, which is kinetically stabilized at room temperature by rapid cooling. Moreover, 23 Na spin-lattice relaxation, which is dominated by fluctuating quadrupolar interactions stimulated by ionic motion in diamagnetic sodium closo-hydridoborate, is enhanced by four orders of magnitude in o-NBH-Q ( T 1  = 0.56 ms) relative to the precursors (Table S3). This magnitude of increased relaxation rate is indicative of rapid Na + mobility in o-NBH, as seen in other families of sodium superionic conductors. 28-31

Variable  temperature  spin-lattice  relaxation  (VT-SLR)  of  the 23 Na  was  measured  to  obtain  the  local  dynamics  of  Na + in o-NBH-Q. 32,33 Two activation  energies  can  be  obtained  from VT-SLR  (Figure  2C);  the  short-range  correlations  or  localized diffusion  is  considered  for  low  temperature  where ω o τ &gt;&gt;  1 holds, while longer-range correlations are considered for high temperature  where ω o τ &lt;&lt;  1  holds. 34,35 The  short-range  and long-range  activation  energies  calculated  from  VT-SLR  are 0.13 and 0.23 eV, respectively, which are lower than the cubic Na4(B12H12)(B10H10) phase, exhibiting hopping barriers of 0.19 and 0.33 eV, respectively, 36 indicating a lower Na + migration barrier  in  the  o-NBH-Q  phase  reported  here.  According  to  the Bloembergen,  Purcell,  and  Pound  (BPP)  model  ( E a LT =  ( β GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1)

E a HT , β being a measure of the strength of correlation with simple BPP behavior), 36-38 a β value of 1.54 indicates uncorrelated Na + motion that stems from coulomb interactions and/or structural disorder,  which  will  be  revisited  computationally  ( vide  infra ). Furthermore, at maximum SLR (Tmax temperature, 30 ◦ C) where τω o ∼ 1 holds, a jump rate (1/ τ ) in the order of 10 8 s GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 is direct evidence of the high ionic conductivity of o-NBH.

To investigate the significance of stabilizing the o-NBH on bulk Na + diffusion,  the  ionic  conductivity  and  activation  energy (Figure  S3)  of  the  o-NBH  prepared  at  different  cooling  rates were measured. Indeed, the ionic conductivity increases while activation  energy  decreases  with  an  increasing  cooling  rate (Figure 2D). The ionic conductivity (at 30 ◦ C) reaches a maximum value  of  4.6  mS  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 when the material was rapidly cooled, which is one of the highest among all sodium solid-state electrolytes reported (Figures S4A and S4B). 39,40 Direct-current polarization experiments (Figure S4C) indicate that the electronic conductivity  is  around  10 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 5 mS  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 ,  which  is  five  orders  of magnitude lower than the ionic conductivity, indicating it is highly electronically insulating. These results support that the resultant ionic conductivity highly correlates to the purity of the o-NBH, which is a function of the cooling rate used during synthesis.

## Ion diffusion mechanism

The Na + diffusion mechanism in the o-NBH crystal structure was systematically investigated using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations with Materials 3-body Graph Network (M3GNet) graph deep learning interatomic potential (GIP). The o-NBH structure has  1/3  Na + occupancy  among  the  seven  sites  in  o-NBH, 24 and the high density of accessible sites within the structure pro- vides multiple pathways for Na + hopping. Additionally, o-NBH exhibits a large variation in the instantaneous coordination number of Na-B12H12 and Na-BH4 (Figure S5) providing a flexible coordination environment and lowering the energy barrier for the fast  Na + diffusion. 13 Compared  with  NaBH4 and  Na2B12H12, which have no Na + site vacancies for ion diffusion (Figure S6), the o-NBH structure exhibits a fast macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) Na + ion diffusion network, as indicated by the yellow isosurfaces in the Na + probability density function (Figure 3A). Beyond the intrinsic Na + site  vacancies that  facilitate  Na ⁺ ion diffusion, dynamic anion motion may disrupt Na ⁺ site ordering, further flattening the overall energy landscape. 13 While angular displacement exists in the anion clusters, the tracked hydrogen atom trajectory for 1 ns indicates the motion is highly randomized, which may not have a periodical promotion in the diffusion (Figure S7). Combining the high Na + site vacancy density, low activation energy, and anion motion, o-NBH exhibits orders of magnitude higher theoretical room-temperature ionic conductivity than its monoclinic-Na2B12H12 and cubic-NaBH4 precursors (Figure 3B).

To better understand the influence of the two distinct polyanion polyhedral (BH4 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; and B12H12 2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; ) in o-NBH on the Na + diffusion dynamics, a series of thought experiment was performed by artificially scaling the mass of each type of polyanion in the MD simulations.  Unlike  previous  works  whereby  anions  were ''frozen''  in  MD, 41,42 this  approach  allows  for  gradual  adjustments  to  the  anion  rotational  dynamics  by  modifying  their moment of inertia without affecting the chemical interactions between the Na + and anions (Figure S8). The simulations show that increasing  anion  mass  (and  decreasing  anion  rotation)  has  a

and  energy  density.  Linear  sweep  voltammetry (LSV) indicates that the highly ionic  conductive  o-NBH  exhibits  good reduction  stability  against  Na9Sn4 but limited oxidation stability, up to 2.2 V vs. Na9Sn4 (Figure 4A). The reduction stability is further demonstrated with symmetrical Na9Sn4//o-NBH//Na9Sn4 cell cycling that showed stable and reversible charge transfer after 100 cycles of 1 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 of (de)sodiation (Figure S10A).

According to the grand potential calculation at 300 K (Figure S10B), the oxidations  lower  than  3.8  V  vs.  Na + /Na  of o-NBH are hypothesized to form a passivating Na2B12H12. The electrochemical oxidation  is  further  probed  by  galvanostatic cycling with different maximum cutoff voltages (Vcutoff) to study the implications  of  the  various  oxidation  products. Initial  desodiation  capacities  of  38  and 90  mAh  g GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 are  observed  with  Vmax of 3.4  and  4.9  V  vs.  Na9Sn4,  respectively; negligible  capacity  is  accessible  in  the subsequent  cycle  (Figure  S10C).  This  is further  supported  by the  increase  in  the small effect on the activation barrier for diffusion, even though there  is  a  marked  decrease  in  ionic  conductivity  (Figure  3C). Instead, the reduction in ionic conductivity is highly correlated to the reduction in the number of active Na + with increasing anion mass. By independently modifying the BH4 and B12H12 masses, it was found that increasing the mass of the larger B12H12 anion has a more pronounced effect on the number of inactive Na and ionic conductivity (Figure S9).

## Electrochemical characterization

While high ionic conductivity is a crucial intrinsic property for a practical solid electrolyte, the electrochemical stability window impacts  the  viability  of  electrodes  with  high  and  low  sodium chemical potential and, therefore, the accessible battery voltage interfacial  impedance  after  oxidation  at  3.4  V  vs.  Na9Sn4 as Na2B12H12  is  still  slightly  ionically  conductive  (Figure  S10D);  a large interfacial impedance was observed after complete oxidation of o-NBH at 4.9 V vs. Na9Sn4.

## Sodium-excess cell (half cell)

To further evaluate the oxidation stability of o-NBH, we prepared three cathode composites: NaCrO2  with o-NBH (NCO/o-NBH), oxidation-resistant Na-Zr-Cl 43 solid-electrolyte-coated  NCO (NCO/NZC),  and  NCO/NZC  with  o-NBH  (NCO/NZC/o-NBH). The material distribution and the interfacial contact within these composites were visualized by reconstructing the crosssectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images prepared by focused ion beam milling (Figure 4B). While the NCO:solid

electrolyte:carbon mass ratio is fixed, the solid-electrolyte volume fraction is higher in o-NBH-containing composite cathode because o-NBH has a lower density ( ∼ 1.2 g cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 3 )  than NZC ( ∼ 2.4  g  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 3 ).  Consequently,  the  ionic  tortuosity  values  for NCO/o-NBH, NCO/NZC, and NCO/NZC/o-NBH are 1.53, 4.91, and 3.46, respectively. This trend correlates with the cathode composite volumetric density and impedance, where NCO/oNBH has the lowest volumetric density and areal resistivity in the series, followed by NCO/NZC/o-NBH and then NCO/NZC (Figure 4C). The higher ionic conductivity and high volumetric content  of  o-NBH,  compared  with  NZC,  facilitates  fast  ion diffusion  in  the  cathode  composite.  While  such  decrease  in composite cathode density will lead to a decrease in the volumetric energy density (Table S6), a balance between volumetric energy density and electrochemical performance is needed for practicality.

Half-cell  ASSBs  were  assembled  using  cathodes  with  an active  material  mass  loading  of  15  mgNCO  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 (theoretical areal  capacity  of  1.8  mAh  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 )  and  Na9Sn4 as  the  counter electrode. As shown in Figure 4D, all the cells have good material utilization (92.5%-104.2% of the theoretical NCO capacity),  with  the  NCO/o-NBH  (1.9  mAh  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 )  cell  exhibiting  a slightly  higher  charge  capacity  than  that  of  NCO/NZC  (1.6 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 ) and NCO/NZC/NBH (1.7 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 ). In the subsequent reverse cycle, the NCO/o-NBH exhibits the lowest initial Coulombic  efficiency  (ICE)  of  91.9%,  while  NCO/NZC  and NCO/NZC/o-NBH  have  higher  ICEs  of ∼ 98.2%.  This  implies that  the  higher-than-theoretical  charge  capacity  in  NCO/oNBH stems from the oxidation of o-NBH. The impact of ionic tortuosity and interfacial compatibility is highlighted in the subsequent  C/3  cycling.  The  interfacial  incompatibility  between NCO and o-NBH leads  to  rapid  capacity  fading  as  reflected by  the  NCO/o-NBH  cell,  retaining  less  than  1  mAh  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 ( ∼ 60%  of  initial  capacity)  after  140  cycles  with  an  average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% (Figure 4E). Credited to the stable electrochemical interface, both NCO/NZC and NCO/NZC/ o-NBH cells exhibited more stable cycling, retaining 1.23 and 1.36  mAh  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 after  140  cycles,  respectively,  and  0.82  and 1.20  mAh  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 after  1,000  cycles,  respectively.  While  the first-cycle differential capacity dQ/dV plot showed similar redox reactions  in  each  cathode-solid-electrolyte  composite  (Figure S11A), the NCO/o-NBH suffered from larger dQ/dV profiles polarization than that of the others (Figures S11B-S11D). Furthermore,  the  NCO/o-NBH  cell  shows  a  faster  rate  of  constantvoltage capacity and an increase in cell impedance with cycle number (Figures S11E and S11F), likely fueled by the continuous formation of non-passivating and ionically insulating interphases due to o-NBH oxidation.

## Thick-cathode zero-excess-sodium cell (full cell)

For  ASSBs  to  displace  conventional  Li-ion  batteries,  they must realize a high areal capacity using a thick cathode, minimizing inactive components at the cell level (Figures 5A and S12), and possess the ability to operate in extreme environments. This would require a high ionic conductive solid electrolyte  and  stable  electrode/electrolyte  interface.  Thus,  we leverage  the  NCO/NZC/o-NBH cathode composite architecture to assemble sodium-inventory-limited ASSBs with high-

cathode areal capacity loading (15, 30, and 45 mgNCO  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 or 1.8, 3.6, and 5.4 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 , corresponding to thicknesses of  approximately  123  ±  0.8,  217  ±  2.6,  and  310  ±  2.0 μ m, respectively; Figure 5B) and Sn as the anode. While material utilization is slightly affected by the increased cathode thickness due to polarization, all cells exhibit a similar ICE (70%81%) owing to sluggish Na + diffusion kinetics of the Sn anode at low states of charge (SOCs), limiting the Na + diffusion at the 2D electrode/electrolyte interface (Figures 5C, S13, and S14). Nevertheless, the ASSBs still deliver high reversible capacities of 1.3, 2.2, and 3.5 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 at 15, 30, and 45 mgNCO  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 loadings, respectively. These are among the highest reported sodium ASSB active material areal loadings (Figure S15) and feature reversible capacities that are close to or higher than conventional  Li-ion  batteries.  Following  the  initial  cycle,  all cells have an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%-99.9% resulting  in  a  capacity  retention  of  &gt;80%  after  100  cycles (Figure 5D).

The  capability  of  the  high  areal  capacity  cell  configuration (45 mgNCO  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 ) is further demonstrated at subzero temperatures, highlighting its viability in cold climates. The cell (Figure  5E)  delivers  high  discharge  capacities  of  3.1,  2.9, 2.8, 2.5, and 1.5 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 at room temperature, 0 ◦ C, GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 5 ◦ C, GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 10 ◦ C, and GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 15 ◦ C, respectively. The decrease in capacity at lower  temperatures  is  attributed  to  increased  cell  impedance (Figure S16). Further examination of the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) spectra also reveals that the Warburg diffusion coefficient  in the  electrodes  also  increases significantly at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 15 ◦ C  compared  with  room  temperature. This suggests that the bulk diffusion in the electrode is one of the  capacity-limiting  factors  when  operating  at  low  temperatures. Alternative electrode active materials with fast bulk diffusion  at  all  SOCs  or  novel  electrode  architecture  should  be considered  to  further  improve  the  kinetics.  Nevertheless,  this work  highlights  that  high-loading  ASSBs  can  operate  in  cold climates without external heating or severe discharge capacity penalty.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, we successfully demonstrate the kinetically stable orthorhombic hydridoborate structure, o-NBH, through precise control of synthesis conditions. The lower symmetry anion framework  exhibits  exceptional  ionic  conductivity  across  a wide temperature  range,  from  0.3  mS  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 at GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 10 ◦ C to  4.6 mS cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 at  30 ◦ C.  Notably,  the  propensity  of  anion's  motion enhances the population of highly mobile Na + , thereby increasing the ionic conductivity, without lowering the Na + activation energy. Incorporating o-NBH into the NCO/NZC cathode composite  effectively  balances  the  electrochemical  stability with  sodium-ion  kinetics  in  the  thick  cathode  composite.  An all-solid-state  sodium-ion  full-cell  battery  with  a  high  NCO loading (45 mgNCO  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 , ∼ 310 μ m thick) and Sn as cathode and anode, respectively,  delivers a  discharge  capacity  of  3.1 and 2.5 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 at  room temperature and GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 10 ◦ C, respectively.  This  study  broadens  the  scope  of  the  solid  electrolyte design, extending beyond  hydridoborate-based chemistry, and introduces new approaches to cell architecture that have the potential to drive the next generation of batteries.

## METHODS

## Material synthesis

All fabrication processes were conducted in an Ar-filled glovebox (H2O and O2 &lt; 5 ppm). To make the Na3(B12H12)(BH4), stoichiometric amounts of Na2B12H12 (Boron Specialties LLC, dried at  175 ◦ C  under  dynamic  vacuum  for  two  nights)  and  NaBH4 (99.99%,  Sigma  Aldrich)  were  hand-mixed  using  a  pestle and  mortar.  Then,  the  mixture  was  sealed  in  a  thin-wall ( ∼ 0.01  mm),  Boron-rich  Ø0.3  mm  capillary  (for in  situ s-XRD sample)  or  an  evacuated  quartz  ampoule  (for  bulk  samples). The material was heated to 410 ◦ C at 3 ◦ C min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 and held for 10 h before cooling at 0.5 ◦ C min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 and 2.0 ◦ C min GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 . To achieve rapid cooling, the material was quenched in the water (for in situ s-XRD sample) or Ar-filled glovebox (for bulk samples) after the thermal treatment.

Na9Sn4 anode was prepared by ball milling sodium metal and tin (Sn, Sigma Aldrich) using Retsch EMAX ball milling at 500 rpm for 3 h with a 30:1 Ø5 mm yttrium-stabilized zirconia ball:material weight  ratio.  NCO  was  prepared  by  solid-state  reaction  of  a pestle and mortar mixed with Na2CO3  and Cr2O3  at 900 ◦ C in an Ar environment for 10 h. NZC solid electrolyte was prepared by  ball  milling  stoichiometric  amounts  of  NaCl  and  ZrCl4 (1:2 molar ratio) 43 using an Retsch EMAX ball miller at 550 rpm for 20 h with a 30:1 30:1 Ø5 mm yttrium-stabilized zirconia ball: material weight ratio.

## Materials characterization Crystal structure analysis

The  high-resolution  s-XRD  and in  situ heating  powder  XRD (PXRD)  were  performed  at  beamline  TPS-19A  in  Taiwan Photon Source (TPS), National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC). The energy for all PXRD was calibrated to 16 keV (0.77489 A ˚ ),  with the geometry and sample position offset corrections calibrated using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard material, LaB6 (660c). A hot air gas blower was placed 2 mm under the capillary sample with a uniform ramp rate of 5 ◦ C/min for the in situ heating experiment. PXRD patterns were collected every 20 ◦ C along  the  temperature  ramping  process.  1D  PXRD  patterns

were recorded by a MYTHEN 18K detector with an exposure time of 60 s.

ss-NMR spectra were recorded under magic angle spinning (MAS) in a static magnetic field of 9.4 T with a Bruker Ascend 400 MHz magnet and a Bruker Avance NEO NMR spectrometer. The samples were packed into 1.6-mm-diameter zirconia rotors in an Ar-filled environment with polyimide and polyamide-imide caps, and spectra were measured with a Phoenix narrow-bore 1.6  mm  HX  probe. T 1 (spin-lattice)  relaxation  was  measured with a saturation-recovery pulse sequence for T 1  &gt; 1 s or an inversion-recovery pulse sequence for T 1 &lt; 1 s. Line broadening of 11 B from heteronuclear dipolar coupling and J-coupling was mitigated by proton decoupling (Figure S17). All spectra were measured  with  a  direct  pulse-acquire  pulse  sequence  using the  following  rf  pulses: 23 Na (45 ◦ ,  0.9 μ s,  135  kHz); 11 B (90 ◦ , 1.73 μ s,  145  kHz)  with  or  without 1 H  decoupling  (SPINAL64, 154 kHz). 1 H- 1 H 2D dipolar-coupling-mediated spin-exchange spectra  (proton  spin  diffusion)  (90 ◦ ,  1.36 μ s,  184  kHz)  with  8 scans per row and 176 rows in the indirect dimension spaced at  50μ s  intervals  were  acquired  with  the  states-time-proportional  phase  incrementation (TPPI)  mode.  Recycle  delays were ≥ 5 T 1.

## Microstructure analysis

Owing to the moisture sensitivity, the sample was transferred from  the  glovebox  to  the  SEM  using  the  QuickLoader.  The cross-section is prepared by focused Ga-ion beam milling, and SEM  images  were  obtained  using  an  FEI  Scios  DualBeam focused ion beam, equipped with an Everhart-Thornley detector. The different Z values  of  the  NCO,  NZC,  and  o-NBH  allow  a different  contrast  in  the  backscattered  electron  beam  microscopy. The 3D reconstructed model of the composite is prepared by milling 200 nm per slice for 10 μ m. Reconstruction of the 18 × 20 × 10 μ m 3 model is done using Thermo Scientific Avizo software. Ionic tortuosity along the z axis (separator to current collector) is calculated using the 3D reconstructed model and Tau factor in MATLAB. 44 The processing and imaging of the sodiated Sn was conducted at cryogenic temperature.

## Electrochemical characterization

Owing to the low modulus nature of o-NBH, the powder was pelletized at 275 MPa at room temperature (Figure S18) before electrochemical measurement. The EIS, LSV, and direct current polarization were conducted using a Biologic VSP200. To measure EIS (from 7 MHz to 1 Hz), around 90-100 mg of the materials were  pelletized  under  a  uniaxial  pressure  of  275  MPa.  Then, acetylene  black  (AB)  was  added  on  both  ends  acting  as  an ion-blocking  electrode  before  compacting  at  120  MPa.  The thickness  of  the  pellet  is  estimated  by  measuring  the  setup before adding the powder and after the 275 MPa palletization using a Vernier caliper. The EIS spectra at various temperatures were recorded by keeping the material under the stated temperatures ( GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 10 ◦ C to 50 ◦ C, at 10 ◦ C per step) for 1 h in an ESPEC temperature chamber.

To investigate the kinetic stability of o-NBH at room temperature, we split one batch of o-NBH-Q into two batches. One is for the immediate EIS measurement (e.g., o-NBH-Q day 0) and the other was kept in a vacuum ampoule at room temperature. Then, the EIS measurement was conducted on the kept o-NBH-Q after 30 days (e.g., o-NBH-Q day 30).

The reduction and reduction LSV sweep were conducted using  o-NBH  and  stainless-steel  powder  (SS,  Sigma-Aldrich) composite with a weight ratio of 1:1 and o-NBH and AB composite with a weight ratio of 7:3, respectively. Both composite electrodes  were  mixed  using  pestle  and  mortar  and  an o-NBH areal loading of 8.9 mg cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 with Na9Sn4 as the counter electrode.

## Electrochemical characterization

Anode preparation . The Sn anode was prepared by casting Sn with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with a weight ratio of 99:1. The sodium-limited ASSB has a negative:positive (NP) electrode capacity ratio of 1.2-1.5, with NCO and Sn having capacities of 120 and 845 mAh g GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , respectively.

Cathode preparation . NCO was chosen because of its relatively  low  redox  potential  of  3.2  V  vs.  Na9Sn4,which  is  very close to the first  oxidation of  o-NBH, which is hypothesized to form the Na2B12H12  and B2H5  interphases. The NCO:solid electrolyte:vapor-grown  carbon  fiber  (VGCF)  cathode  composite has a mass  ratio 60:38:2. The intimate contact between  NCO  and  NZC  was  prepared  by  ball  milling  NCO and NZC using the PM200 at 160 rpm for 1 h (10 min of milling and 2 min of rest) with a 20:1 Ø1 mm yttrium-stabilized zirconia ball:material weight ratio. The NCO/NZC/o-NBH cathode composite  has  the  (NCO/NZC):o-NBH:VGCF  weight  ratio  of (60:20):18:2. All composites were hand-mixed using a pestle and mortar.

ASSBs  fabrication . 55-60  mg  of  o-NBH  powder  was  first pressed into a pellet at 275 MPa in a Ø10 mm peek sleeve using two titanium rods forming a ∼ 540- to 620μ m-thick solid electrolyte  separator.  Then,  19.6,  39.3,  and  58.9  mg  of  the  cathode composite to make 15, 30, and 45 mgNCO cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 for a Ø10 mm cavity,  respectively.  Anode  (35  mg  of  Na9Sn4 or  appropriate amount of Sn) was introduced on the other end. The cell was then pressed to 275 MPa.

Cycling protocol . The cells were clamped between two stainless steel plates held by bolts and nuts. For room-temperature cycling, the cells were cycled within the Ar-filled glovebox. The symmetrical Na9Sn4/o-NBH/Na9Sn4 cell was cycled with a current  density  of  0.2  mA  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 and  5  h  per  half  cycle  (1  mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 ).  The  half  or  full  cells  were  charged  with  constant  current-constant-voltage (CCCV) protocol, with the constant voltage set at 3.4 V and cutoff at 0.1 C (where 1 C = 120 mA g GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 ).  The  cell  was  contained  within  a  homemade  leakproof enclosure in the Ar-filled glovebox for low-temperature discharge performance before transferring it out. The cell was charged  at  20 ◦ C  and  discharged  at  0 ◦ C, GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 5 ◦ C, GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 10 ◦ C,  and GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 15 ◦ C in an ESPEC temperature chamber. All cells were cycled using  a  Landt  battery  cycler  under  an  operating  pressure  of 75 MPa.

Effective  capacity  of  ASSBs . To  visualize  the  importance  of realizing high-cathode loading cathode in battery, we calculated the estimated cell capacity considering the number of aluminum foil and solid electrolyte separators needed to achieve the target capacity. Three anodes, anode-free, Sn, and hard carbon, with a NP capacity ratio of 1.1 are considered in this illustration. Based on the previous study, 9 hard carbon would work well when mixed with solid electrolyte at a weight ratio of 7:3 so the mass of the hard carbon anode is corrected accordingly. The energy density

of the full cell calculation in Figure 5A is based on the following assumptions:

- (1) Aluminum current collector: 2.7 g cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 3 , 20 μ m.
- (2) Solid electrolyte separator: 1.3 g cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 3 , 50 μ m.
- (3) NP electrode ratio: 1.1.
- (4) Tin capacity: 847 mAh g GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 .
- (5) Hard carbon capacity: 250 mAh g GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 .
- (6) Target areal capacity: 7.2 mAh cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 2 .

## Computational methods

## DFT calculations of the ss-NMR

The ss-NMR tensor calculations were carried out in the planewave pseudopotential code CASTEP v23.1 (Clark et al. 45 )  on DFT-optimized structures taken from the literature. 24 The calculations used the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional 46 and ultrasoft on-the-fly pseudopotentials generated in  CASTEP with a plane-wave energy cutoff of 800 eV and a Monkhorst-Pack k -point  grid  spacing  finer  than  0.04 × 2 π A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 . 47 Geometry optimization was performed with the limitedmemory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (LBFGS) algorithm 48 until  the  forces  on  atoms  and  stresses  on  the  cell converged to better than 0.01 eV A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 and 100 MPa, respectively. Subsequently,  the  NMR  chemical  shielding  and  quadrupolar interaction tensors were calculated using the gauge-including projector augmented-wave (GIPAW) approach. 49-51

## Training structure generation and M3GNet training

The M3GNet architecture has already been extensive covered in previous work. 52 To develop a robust training data for Na-B-H M3GNet GIP, the following data generation protocol was used:

- (1) First, we extract all crystals in the Na-B-H chemical systems in Materials Project and Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). 53,54 All structures were optimized with revised  regularized  strongly  constrained  and  appropriately  normed  (r 2 SCAN)  functional. 52 The  ground-state structures and  relaxation trajectories (89 structures) were also included in the training dataset.
- (2) To expand the configuration space to cover more diverse local  environments, particularly  at higher temperatures, canonical ensemble (NVT) MD simulations were carried out  using  the  pre-trained  M3GNet  universal  potential 52 on the relaxed structures for 10 ps with a time interval of 10  fs.  Simulations  were  also  performed  at  5  strains (0, ±0.05, ±0.1) and 5 temperatures (300-900 K with an interval of 150 K). We then sampled the snapshots using the dimensionality-reduced encoded clusters with stratified (DIRECT) sampling approach described in Qi et al. 55 to ensure good coverage of the configuration space.
- (3) Static self-consistent calculations with r 2 SCAN functional were performed on the training structures obtained from step  2  to  obtain  the  energies,  forces,  and  stresses  for M3GNet  training.  All  calculations  were  performed  with an  energy  cutoff  of  680  eV,  a k spacing  of  0.35  A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , and  an  electronic  relaxation  convergence  condition  of 1 × 10 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 5  eV atom GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 . 56
- (4) The dataset was split into 9:1 as training and testing dataset. The radius cutoff is 5 A ˚  and the three-body cutoff is 4 A ˚ .

The mean absolute error (MAE) of training energies, forces, and stresses were 20.96 meV atom GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , 0.15 eV A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , and 1.54 meV A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 3 , respectively,  while  the  MAE  of  the  testing  set  was  30.20  meV atom GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , 0.16 eV A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , and 1.80 meV A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 3 , respectively.

All training,  sampling,  evaluations,  and  simulations  with M3GNet were performed using LAMMPS, 57 Materials Graph Library (MatGL), and the Materials Machine Learning (maml) Python package.

## DFT calculation

All DFT calculations were performed by Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) 58 with projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials. The r 2 SCAN meta-generalized gradient approximation  (GGA) 46 functional  was  utilized  for  structural  relaxation. Spin-polarized calculations with an energy cutoff of 680 eV, a k spacing of 0.35 A ˚ GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 , and an electronic relaxation convergence condition of 1 × 10 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 5  eV atom GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 were applied to the structural relaxations.

## Na-B-H phase diagram calculation

The thermodynamic properties of the fixed-volume solid are estimated using phonon energies, which depend on the frequencies and the lattice internal energy from DFT calculation at 0 K. The Gibbs free energy at pressure (p), temperature (T), and volume (V) is given by G ( V , T ) = UL ( V ) + UV ( V , T ) GLYPH&lt;0&gt; TS ( V , T ) + pV , where Uv ( V , T ) and S ( V , T ) represent the vibrational internal energy and vibrational  entropy  due to  phonon contributions,  respectively. The expressions for Uv and S are given as follows, 59

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ω q ; j represents the phonon frequency at the wave vector q and band index j .  The  dependence  on  volume  is  omitted  for simplicity. kB and /uni210F refer  to  the  Boltzmann  constant  and  the reduced Planck constant, respectively.

To efficiently  obtain  the  vibrational  contributions  to  the  entropy, phonon calculations were performed using a highly accurate M3GNet GIP fitted from a dataset of 5,595 r 2 SCAN calculations. Then, we calculated the Helmholtz free energies for each compound in  the  Na-B-H  phase  diagram  at  300  and  650  K. The phonon thermodynamic properties were computed using the fitted Na-B-H GIP.

## Machine learning interatomic potential and MD simulations

The  r 2 SCAN relaxed  bulk  materials  cubic-NaBH4 (12  atoms), monoclinic-Na2B12H12 (52  atoms),  and  o-NBH  (128  atoms) were replicated by 4 × 4 × 4, 4 × 2 × 2, 2 × 2 × 2 so that all lattice parameters were larger than 10 A ˚ .  MD simulations were performed for 1 ns using pre-trained M3GNet potential at temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 K, starting with 25 K increments

from 300 to 500 K, followed by 50 K increments up to 600 K, and then increasing by 100 K from 600 to 800 K. The simulation utilized  the  NPT  ensembles  with  a  time  step  of  1  fs.  All  MD simulations  were  carried  out  with  LAMMPS.  The  visualization of trajectories was achieved by OVITO. The diffusivities were extracted from the MD trajectories by using the pymatgen-analysis-diffusion package. 60,61

The diffusion coefficient (D) of Na + ions was determined by applying  a  linear  fit  to  the  mean  square  displacement  (MSD) vs. time (t) using the Einstein-Smoluchowski equation as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where r → ( t ) is the position of the atom at the time t , τ is the time interval between atom positions r → ( t + τ ) and r → ( t ) . The MSD is computed by [ r → ( t + τ ) GLYPH&lt;0&gt; r → ( t )] 2 .  Therefore, the ionic conductivity is determined by the Nernst-Einstein equation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where n represents the Na atom density, e is the elementary charge, Z denotes the Li-ion charge, k B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Activation energies (Ea) were further determined by generating the Arrhenius plots.

The rotation speeds of B12H12 2 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; and BH4 GLYPH&lt;0&gt; anions are artificially manipulated by proportionally increasing the cluster atomic mass. The rotation speed of each anion is determined as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where r → ( t ) is the position of the atom at the time t , τ is the time interval between atom positions r → ( t + τ ) and r → ( t ) . Δ com is the difference  in  the  center-of-mass  position  between  the  time steps, the Euclidean norm ‖ ⋅ ‖ computes the distance, natom represents the total number of atoms, and R denotes the radius of the anions.

Estimating the active Na + ions in the o-NBH is conducted by tracing the 96 Na + ions in the structure during the simulation.  Based  on  the  Equation  3 and  4 relationship,  the average  Na + MSD to achieve  the  18.39  mS  cm GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 1 at  300  K is  estimated  to  be  around  21  A ˚ 2 .  We  also  noted  that  the MSD of H, which exhibits only rotational but no long-ranged translational  motion,  is  around  18  A ˚ 2 .  Thus,  we  have  adopted  a  more  moderate  cutoff  of  21  A ˚ 2 as  the  minimum  MSD required for a Na + to be considered ''active.'' The number of active  Na + is  then  normalized  by  96  Na + that  are  simulated in  the  calculation.
