## 1.1. General  Intentions

Although the  significance of  boundary layers for  the  general behaviour  of  electronic systems  was recognized  very  early, in  the case  of  ionic conduction  the  main emphasis  has  been  placed  on  the  bulk properties. This  was very  fundamentally  connected  with  the  search  for  'super-ionic conductors'.

With regard  to  those  properties of  ionic conductors  that quite  obviously  involve interfaces, as  in the  fields of  catalysis, photography,  sensors and electrode kinetics, intensive efforts are  being  made at  the  moment to  obtain  information  concerning  boundary zones.

In  spite of  a  few  earlier publications, the  full significance of  boundary layers with  respect to  ionic conductivity was first brought out by the  experiments  of  Liang [l] who  made  a systematic study of  the  electrical properties of  the  two-phase  system  LiI-A1203  and found that the  ionic conduction was anomalously high  in  comparison with  that  of  the  pure  phases. Since  then  a whole range of similar effects have  been  reported  in  the  literature. Especially the  group of  J. B.  Wagner  et  al. played a  major role in  this respect [2]. Such solid electrolyte systems  are  known  as  'composite  electrolytes' or  'heterogeneous  electrolytes' * [3-51 and have  been  the  subject of  intense discussion at  specialist conferences.

The purpose of  this article is to  summarize the  experimental  and theoretical approaches  in  this field with  emphasis  on the  author's work on defect chemistry  in  space  charges  in  particular ([3,4,619]) and to  discuss it within  the  context  of  overall developments.  In  order  to  keep  this article within limits, for  more details the  reader  is referred to  the  original publications (for details see  [3,4,6-191).

Particular emphasis  is placed  on presenting the  concept  of  space  charge, which provides a  natural bridge  between bulk properties and those  of  the  neighbouring  phase.  It  hence possesses general importance and is able  to  explain many  aspects of  conductivity in  heterogeneous  systems. In  other words it  is  a major purpose to elucidate the  general  significance of a defect  chemistry  in  space charge regions  and its relevance  especially for  transport properties. It  is not the  aim to give  an overview  over  conducting  effects in  heterogeneous  systems. Thus,  aspects which concern  interfacial migration  due to  a  high  mobility  within the  core  layer will be only  marginally  touched upon  [20].

Three interfaces that  are  of  general  importance in  this context  will be treated:

- (a)  the  ionic  conductor/insulator interface (MX/A)  [6]
- (b)  the  interface between two different ionic conductors  (MXfMX') [7,16]
- (c)  grain  boundaries  (MX/MX) [9]
- (d)  the  ionic conductor/gas  interface [17]

The treatment  is set out  in  the  following manner: Firstly the  principles and quantitative considerations of  defect chemistry  at  interfaces are  presented. The second  step  consists of  the  calculation

* The  term 'heterogeneous  electrolyte' [3,4] is  more  comprehensive and also  includes, e.g. those  pure polycrystalline materials the  grain  boundaries  of  which contribute significantly to  the  overall ionic  conductivity.

## 1. INTRODUCTION

of  the  (parallel and/or  perpendicular) conductivity of  a  boundary  layer  and a discussion of  relevant  experiments. Then -  in  order  to  be  able to  describe practical systems  -  there  is a  discussion of  the  conductivity effects in  dispersed systems  on the  basis of  a  simple  distribution topology  and comparison with  the  particular experimental  data.

This  applies not only  to  the  majority  charge  carriers (ions) but  also  to  the  minority  ones  (electrons)  [4,11] and allows  us  to  establish a general  defect  chemistry  of  space  charge  layers. Finally these  considerations -both experimental  and theoretical -are also  applied  to nanosystems [IO, 121  in  which these  boundary  layer effects occur  to  a  greater degree.

In addition  to the conductivity  aspects, implications for  heterogeneous  catalysis [18], phase boundary  reactions and phase  transformation will be outlined. Before  this, however,  we will return to  the  experimental findings with  respect to  the  two-phase  effect and its impact  on  ionic conductivity.

## 1.2. The SigniJicance  of 'Heterogeneous  Doping'

There are, in  principle, two ways of optimizing  ionic  conductivity: a search  can be made, on the one hand, for  new  compounds and structures, and, on the other  hand, modifications can be made  to given  materials. The  classical method  to achieve  the  latter, involves  homogeneous doping:  Here suitable materials with  aliovalent ions  are  usually dissolved in  the  matrix  in  order  to influence the  concentration of  charge  carriers. In  an  analogous  manner  we will refer to  influencing the  conductivity  by 'physical' addition  of  coexisting second phases  as  'heterogeneous  doping' [3a]. While the  effect of  homogeneous doping is  attributable to  the  fulfillment of  local  electrical neutrality, for  heterogeneous  doping  it is, as  will be  demonstrated  in  detail, the  deviation from local electrical neutrality that  is  of great  importance.  The  similarities in  principle and the  differences between the  two methods are  discussed in  detail below.

After  Liang's experiment  similar enhancement effects were discovered in  a  whole range  of  moderate ionic conductors,  principally Li,  Cu and Ag halides [ 1,3,4,8,2 l-481 (recently some alkali and alkali earth  metal  halides too [24,49-571). Besides  Al203 other  oxides  such  as  SiOz,  CeOz, ZrOz and BaTi have been found to  be also  effective. These 'heterogeneous  electrolytes' are  usually prepared by fusing  the  ion-conducting  matrix  material. Typical  volume compositions  (VA) comprise  lo-40  v/o  second phase.  Typical  mean  particle diameters  (2fA)  are  less than 1  p, typical increases in  conductivity are  one to  two orders  of  magnitude.

Figure  1  refers to  the  classical experiment  by  Liang  [l]. However, the  conductivity here  is plotted against the  volume  fraction of  Al203 in  anticipation of  our treatment  [3]. It  can  be seen  that  the conductivity  increases linearly to  a  maximum value, that  amounts to  about 50  times  the  original conductivity  (pure LiI); the insulating effect of the second phase becomes  apparent at  higher concentrations of  Al203 and the  conductivity falls drastically.

Figure  2  shows the  effect of  heterogeneous  doping  with  y -Al203  on a  range  of  ionic conductors with  appreciable cationic mobility.

As can  be  seen  from Fig. 3  Shahi  and  Wagner Jr. [59] also found considerable conductivity effects in  two-phase  mixtures  of  two coexisting ionic conductors, namely within  the  miscibility gap of  the system  AgBr-AgI. A more detailed study  of  the  system  AgCl-AgI  is described in  Chapter 3  [lq.

A range  of  different cases can  be  expected  in  such  two-phase  mixtures, even  when X-ray  methods cannot detect any global  reactions of  the  two phases  (cf. Fig.  1,2). The most important  ones  are:

- (1)  The simplest case  is that  the  underlying  structure is maintained  up to  that atomic  layer which forms the  layer of  contact. As a  consequence all the  materials parameters  can be assumed to behave in  a  step function  way.  This  case  will be considered  in  the  following.
- (2)  Close  to  the  interface the  materials parameters  may change more smoothly due to  a  structural adjustment  or  to  gradient energy  effects. This  includes also  elastic effects.
- (3)  Impurities may  be injected which are  mobile themselves  (e.g. protons)  and /or  change the concentration  of  mobile defects.
- (4)  Higher dimensional  defects such  as  dislocations may  be  formed to  compensate the  interfacial misfit (partial equilibrium) or  simply  due to  non-equilibrium  conditions.
- (5)  Thin layers of a third  phase may  be formed, the  restricted width of which may  be due to thermodynamic reasons  (interfacial thermodynamics, see  chapter  2.5.2) or due to kinetic

It can be  seen  that the  slope  in  the  region of increasing conductivity can scarcely be distinguished from that  in the extrinsic region  of homogeneous samples (contamination  with high  valency  cations) 1131. The data  of  AgLA1203 are  taken  from the  literature [26].

## reasons.

All  the  heterogeneities described above can have  a  double  influence in  that  they

- (a)  provide  a  'new' kinetic pathway themseives  and/or
- (b)  influence the  conductivity -  basically by affecting the  point  defect  concentration -  in  the adjacent  boundary  zones.

In  the  simplest approximation  (see I)  which will be  chiefly considered here, the  region  of  adjust-

Fig.  5.  The  solid line  (bisector of the  angle) shows that  the  effective activation enthalpy  (Et) of the  (sukiently strong) heterogeneously doped ionic  conductors  AgCI, AgI, AgBr, TICI,  LiI approximately  equals  the  migration  enthalpy  of  the  cation  vacancies  (h+; n ).  Also included  in the  figure are, for  the  purpose of  comparison,  other  characteristic data: migration  enthalpy  of the  counter  defect  (h-; q ), formation  enthalpy  (AH'; plus)  and intrinsic activation enthalpy  of conductivity (AH'/2 + t+h+ +  t-h\_; t: transfer number).

ment is  the  space  charge  layer  (scl), i.e. the  region  of  redistribution of  ionic  and electronic point defects.

While a  more or  less independent  migration  enthalpy  should  occur  in case  a), it is to  be  expected in  case  b)  that, to  a  first approximation,  the  migration  part  of  the  activation enthalpy  is essentially the  bulk  value  (this assumes that  the  elastic effects are  not  too  large).

The space  charge  concept  as  the  explanation of  the  'alumina-effect' is strongly supported  by the fact  that  i) these  effects are  boundary  layer phenomena;  in  particular, impurity  effects, i.e. homogeneous doping have  been ruled  out  (see Chapter 2,  in  particular 2.5.3)  while  ii) notwithstanding the  effective activation enthalpy  of  the  enhanced conductivity comes very  close to  bulk  migration enthalpies (of  the  metal  vacancies in  Fig. 5)  in  the  cited examples.  This  is shown in  Fig.  5  together with  other  activation data. The relevance of  other  explanations will be  discussed later, in  particular those  by Phipps  [41] and Dudney  [60] (Chapter  2.5.3). Especially the  connection  between point  1) and the  space  charge  concept  will be discussed there.

Apart  from these experimental effects the  space charge  concept  is of  general nature  and represents the  natural extension  of  volume-defect  thermodynamics  based  on the  principle of  local electrical neutrality.

Carl  Wagner was the  first to use  the  space  charge  concept to  explain  conductivity  effects in semiconducting two-phase mixtures  [61]. For ionic  conductor systems  T. Jow and J.B.  Wagner Jr.  [32] have discussed  a semiquantitative space  charge  model. The  indeterminacy  of important parameters  (effective space  charge  concentration) in  their model makes it impossible  to  calculate absolute values, or  the  temperature  dependence of  the  effect. A further weakness  lies in  the  fact that no explicit account  is taken  of  the  coupled  interfacial phenomena  which are  -  as  will be  described

below -  those  that  make  possible appreciable deviation from volume defect chemistry. (As  far  as the  dependence on geometrical  parameters  is concerned,  the  reader  is  referred to  Chapter 2.3.3.) Most  theoretical publications [58,62-651 have addressed  the  calculation of the  superposition of given  conductivity pathways in  an heterogeneous  system.

In  the  following  it is  shown  how  to  derive  quantitatively profiles of  the  defect  concentrations, the  partial conductivity  and the  effective (measured)  specific conductivity for  various  boundary problems by starting from local thermodynamic  and electrostatic relationships. The relationships derived  reflect he  dependence on geometric  parameters, on temperature  and on interfacial activity. The  conductivity  of two-phase mixtures  is  calculated on the basis  of a greatly  simplified, but relevant distribution topology (in contrast to  e.g. random  distribution). A series of  accompanying experiments  confirm  that in  particular the  theoretical results obtained  with  AgCl and AgBr, where the  necessary data  are  available, are  in  quantitative agreement  with  the  experiment. The dependence on the  activity of  the  second  phase, the  dependence on  concentration, particle size and temperature, the  impedance  spectra and,  with  additional assumptions,  the  absolute values  can be given.  Also the  dependence on the  component  activity follows  from the  model. Far-ranging  conclusions  are possible concerning  the  defect-inducing interfacial mechanism. Predictions can  be  made concerning changes  in  the  mechanism  of  conductivity (TlCl), advantageous  strategies and limits with  respect to further optimization, as  well  as  concerning  effects on heterogeneous  catalysis, boundary reactions, or sensing  activities. It  is  possible to extend and verify  experimentally the concepts to related effects in  polycrystalline materials, to  ionic conductor/gas  interfaces and nanosystems in  general. In  addition, by consideration of  the  minority  carriers, the  establishing of  a  general defect chemistry of  boundary  layers and the  extension to  mixed conductors  is possible. Also the  characterization of space  charge  regions of  a  single interface by impedance spectroscopy  is described.

The fundamental concepts  will now  be  discussed on the  basis of  the  ionic conductor /  insulator interface as  an  example and assuming  Frenkel  defects in  the  ion  conducting  matrix  'M+X-'.  Other interfaces and other  types  of  defects will then  be  considered. The changes  in  defect chemistry  of  the phase  will be  regarded  as  'perturbations', i.e. changes  in mobility  and in  thermodynamic  standard potentials in  MX will be neglected.

## 2.  THE IONIC CONDUCTOR/INSULATOR INTERFACE (HETEROGENEOUS DOPING)

## 2.1. Defect  Chemktry

In  a Frenkel  disordered  solid (M+X-) disorder means  that  some  of  the  cations  have left their regular  positions  (regular cation: MM)  * have occupied interstitial positions (vacant  interstitial positions Vi,  occupied  interstitial positions: M;)* and have  left behind vacancies  (V,')*:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  Eq. (Rl) Vi denotes  a vacant  interstitial site. In  contrast to  the  regular particles, Mi  and V&amp;, are  typical mobile ionic  centres. When  the  number  of electronic defects and of  impurity  ions  is negligible the  bulk  concentrations of  ionic  defects must be equal  t and fixed  by the  mass action constant  (&amp;)  on account of  the  necessity for  local electrical neutrality:

AFGO  is the  standard  free enthalpy  of  the  reaction (Rl)*,  Ni  and N, refer to  the  mole fraction of the  building elements  (Mi'  - Vi)  and (Vh - MM).

* The Kroger-Vink notation  is  used  [66]: In  the  symbol D;I, D denotes  the  species (M  stands  for  cationic species, V for vacancy)  occupying the  position p (M: cation  position; i: interstitial position). The symbol r  denotes  the  relative charge (i.e. the  absolute charge  of  D  on p minus the  absolute charge  of  the  regular species on p).

t Note that  the  results are  not  restricted to  that  approximation.

This does not apply any longer  to boundary  layers. Let us  first consider  a 'free  surface' * As Frenkel  [67] has already  emphasized and as  was quantified very  early  in  the  electrochemistry of  liquid electrolytes, there  are  deviations from local electroneutrality and,  hence,  from bulk  stoichiometry in  the  regions close  to  the  surface. The best  way of  regarding  this in  our  case  is to  split the  Frenkel  reaction  (RI) [67,68] into  the  separate reactions for  formation  of  the  defects (R2a,b) with  the  associated quantities AvG* and AiG*  [3]

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

(This  procedure  used  in  Ref.  [68,69] is not  really sufficient in  that the  AvG*  and AiG* values are  not materials parameters (e.g. standard  values) since they  include a change in  the  electrical potential that  depends on the  concentrations. This  is considered  more accurately below.)

Here a  regular cation is first  ransported to  the  'free'5 surface (surface site denoted by 's') while a  vacancy is formed,  and only  then  to  the  interstitial site leading to  the  formation  of  the  interstitial defect. It  can be seen  qualitatively that  stabilization of the  cation  at  the  interface displaces the upper reaction  to  the  right and the  lower  reaction to  the  left. This  increases the  concentration  of vacancies  and lowers  that  of  the  interstitial defects.

Figure  6a  shows that the  defect concentrations are  identical in  intrinsic bulk  (X  CO), but  as  the free surface  (hatched) is approached the  profile diverges. However  this effect -  as  can  be  estimated from the  literature data  on defect formation  for  say  AgCl  and AgBr  -  is not  nearly  large enough to  explain  the  conductivity effects actually observed.

However, if a  second  phase  is present, that -  and this is the  fundamental  concept  in  this context [3,6] -  can influence the  chemical  potential of  the  cation  directly at  the  interface, then  this effect can be very large  (see  Fig.  6b).  The  second phase (A) can exert  a stabilizing effect (I) whereby cations  are  increasingly drawn from the space  charge  zones to the  proper interfacial layer  and vacancies  are  produced in  the  space  charge  region, or  a  destabilizing effect, whereby in  the  case  of a  material containing  Frenkel  defects the  cations are  increasingly driven  into  interstitial positions (II). In  the  case  of  a  contacted  surface reaction equations  (R2a)  and (R2b) are  replaced  by [3,6]:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

(A denotes  an interfacial position here.) This  means that  the  thermodynamic  balance  has  to  take account of a surface-surface interaction (transport of the  cation  from the  free  to  the  contacted surface):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

It  suffices to consider  (R3a) since  the  reaction  equation  (R3b) is  redundant on account of the validity of  the  Frenkel  reaction (Rl).

In  the  case  of  local equilibrium it is sufficient to  transport one defect type  virtually from the  bulk to  the  interface and keep in  mind the  validity of  the  coupling  equilibria (here  (R  1)). The different steps -  as  illustrated in  Fig. 7  -  can be  described by an electrochemical (E)  reaction of  the  form A(x)  + B(x')  the  equilibria of  which can be determined  by pa  (x' )  = DA (x')  (,k electrochemical potential, x and x'  denote  two different loci). For the  special cases  A I B and x = x'  we arrived  at the  special cases  of  pure  transport (T)  and and chemical  reaction (C),  respectively [ 141. fij can be broken down  into  a  chemical  and an electrical term:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

* It is usual  in  the  literature to  consider a 'free' surface. Such a  term  has  no meaning in  the  strict hermodynamic  sense. It  is necessary to  consider a  defined neighbouring  phase, e.g. a  gas  phase  in  order  to  define the  sample  thermodynamically. Here it  is  assumed  as  a 'model' that  the  gaseous  neighbouring  phase has, as  will later be quantified. a comparatively slight influence on the  interfacial ionic  defect  concentrations.

(pj:  chemical potential, 4: electrical potential). As is  already  implicit in  Eq. (1), here we will consider  dilute defect concentrations, even  though this limit is exceeded  here  and there. In  this case it is  possible to  relate the  chemical  potential linearly to  the  mole fraction of  defects ($  defects/g lattice molecules).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

(pj : chemical  standard  potential). The concentration term stems  from the  configurational entropy, while  the  standard  term  contains all the  concentration-independent energy  and entropy  parameters such  as  partial enthalpies of  formation,  partial vibrational entropy  of  the  defects etc.

In the following  $ is  independent of x as  long as  the  structure does not change,  the  variable x represents the  distance from the  .interface; x = 0 designates that  atomic position  of MX that immediately  adjoins the  (idealized) interface.

The profile of  the  electrochemical functions of  interest near  a  (ideal as  defined  above)  interface is  illustrated in  Fig.  8a (see also  Fig.  6,  Appendix  1). Heed  is  also  paid  to  the  constancy of  the electrochemical potentials of  the  charged components  and the  chemical  potential of  the  neutral component.  It  is  naturally also  possible to  describe the  boundary  layer  situation for  ions  (Fig.

Fig.  7.  For the  solution of  the  basic defect-chemical problem at  the  interface the  indicated steps have  to  be  considered. In  principle each  equilibrium can  be  handled  by  considering a  generalized electrochemical reaction (E)  A(x) + B(x')  where the  'species' (and  thus  /.I') and/or  the  space coordinate  (and  thus  4) may  change.  The terms  C,  T refer to  the  special cases  of  pure  chemical reaction (x  = x')  and pure  transport (A = B),  respectively.

(The principal differences from the  electronic picture of  classical semiconductors (strict localization, single level scheme,  migration  threshold  always  present) are indicated in  Fig.  8c  (cross section parallel to  interface)). The chemical  representation in  Fig. 8a  is more useful  for  our general  considerations that  can  handle  ions  and electrons simultaneously.

The solution of  our  problem,  i.e. the  calculation of  the  concentration profile and its reference to standard  values, requires the  following steps [3e,4], see  also  Appendix 1, Fig.  80,  8  1):

- (1) Calculation  of  the  bulk  concentrations Nj,: with  the  assumption of the at  for  our  example.  Thus in  the  following and

This  is a  typical bulk  defect problem and uses  the  above relationships local electrical neutrality (ultimately a  symmetry property  since (1 &amp;p/ax ]X\_m  = 0). This  is state-of-the-art and Eq. (1)  is immediately  arrived we assume that  we know  Njm as  a  function  of  temperature  (T), component  activity (a), doping content  (C). (In  the  Brouwer approximation  Njm = ~ja'jC''/II,KY ( T) .)

- (2) Calculation of  the  local concentration increase &lt;j  = Nj  / Nj,:

The expression  &lt;j'  is evidently independent  of  the  type  of  defect (i,v;n (for e'), p (for h.). This is illustrated in  Fig.  9 for 1 Zj  (  = 1.  For positive values  of  (# - Cpoo) the  concentrations of  all negative  defects are  raised by the  factor exp  [-F(c#I - +,)/(RT)],  while  those  of  the positive defects are  reduced  by the  same factor.

Combination  with  Eq.  (6) leads, since p(x) = CjzjFcj(x),  to  the  differential equation  (with Yj I -In cj)

that is known  in  the  literature as  the  Poisson-Boltzmann differential equation. In  the  following we will limit ourselves to  the  usual  case  of  two major charge  carriers [6], namely monovalent cation  vacancies and interstitial defects. There are  no problems  -  and this is important  for  the discussion of  the  extrinsic regime  in  ion  conductors  -  in  application to  other  charge  carriers so long as  the  absolute  charge  numbers  are  the  same.  The  complementary  case  and more general  questions  of stoichiometry, associated with appreciable concentrations of electrons must be discussed separately.

If  we consider  a  planar  interface and assume that  the  extent of  the  ion  conductor material is large with  respect to  h,  then  it is possible to  integrate Eq. (9) to  yield:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The interfacial interaction is  now  clearly incorporated  in  the  g-parameter introduced  in  [6]. This g-parameter is  of  great  phenomenological utility [6] even if there  may  be no adequate model for  further analysis. 9i  is connected  to  &lt;io  via:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

9j is  zero  if no boundary  effects occur (point  of  zero  charge,  GO = 1), varies between 0 and +1 for  an enrichment effect (with  respect to  j)  and between 0 and -1  for  a depletion  effect (with  respect to  j). Hence we will designate this 9 parameter  as  the  'degree  of  influence'. Its variation with  respect to  log TO  is made  evident  in  Fig.  10.

The expressions derived  so  far  allow  us  to  calculate the  conductivity effect, whereby N,,io plays  the  role of  a  parameter.

- Although it is not  decisive at  this point  we will now look  at  how  the  parameter  iVj0 and hence Nj  (x, T) can be related to  standard  materials constants (step 3)  [3e,4]. As mentioned above it was sufficient to  consider the  reaction equation  (R3a).  Since  we have  reduced  our  problem taking  account of  the  electrical work required  and assuming constant  standard  potentials in MX  -  to  that of  the  question of  the  interface, we can,  for  a  further analysis, imagine  Vh  and MM (in  MX) localized in  Eq.  (R3a)  immediately  at  the  interface (x  = 0)  ('bulk  structure' is still assumed here) while  we assume the  (quasi)particles Vi and MA  in  the  proper  contact  layer with  new standard  potentials. In  the  simplest case  this means at  a  distance of  x = X.4 = s  from the  first MX layer (x  = 0  )  (see Fig. 7). From  the  general equilibrium conditions it follows that:

If  we assume that the  electrical term In KOA is small  or  constant  with  respect to  concentration -which is  actually never  strictly fulfilled [14] -, then  two results can be derived  immediately, these are  associated in  the  literature with  the  names  Kliewer  and Kohler [68] and Pijppel and Blakely [69] and relate the  defect  concentrations with  the  enthalpy  of  defect formation  for  'free'  surfaces. The  fact  that  this is  accomplished here  so  simply  (see the  original publication [68]) and that  the limits of this model  are  indicated at  the  same time  is a clear  demonstration  of  the  efficiency of defect  chemical thermodynamics  * . As a first approximation we can regard  the  activity term as being  constant  for  the  limiting case  of  a high  cation  density  in  the  interaction layer  (interfacial layer) t (lbc,o/c,ol &lt;&lt; ~GCMA/CMA~), and Kliewer's result follows already  in  an  improved form

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Analogously with  (R3b) or  simply  with  Eq. (1)  it follows that

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The inadequacy of  the  Kliewer  model in  the  general case  is evident  from the  derivation and it can be seen  that  even the  crudest  approximation must take  into  account the  entropy of mixing the surface  cations. (In  the  limiting case  low concentrations: UMA - [occupied  surface sitesy[available surface  sites]).

Piippel and Blakely  showed that the  fraction [occupied  surface sites] /  [unoccupied  surface sites] is  a  better approximation for  UMs at  higher  concentrations * . However, in  our contect  this result is helpful  only  in  a  semiquantitative sense  because  interactions that  have  been neglected  a priori occur  at  the  higher  concentrations where deviations make  themselves  felt.

(It is  worth noting  that  also  in  the  discussion of segregation effects the  influence of  the  electric potential changes between x = 0 and XA have  been ignored.)

In the  case  of  an  exact  calculation it is also  necessary to  take  account  of  the  condition  of  global electrical neutrality (or  continuity  of the dielectric displacement, see  Poisson  equation), which provides  a relationship between c,,a  and the  concentration  c~s that  appears  as  a new  variable (cf. [7]). Activity  coefficients must naturally be introduced  if  the  concentrations are  appreciable. Their  calculation demands  a detailed model of  the  core  layer. In  order  to  refer the  concentration parameters  to  materials parameters  it is necessary  to  calculate the  value  of KOA in  Eq.  (13). This  is

*  The more  fundamental reason  that  we arrived at  these  results in  such  a  straightforward way,  lies in  the  possibility to proceed  from the  ionic  level to  the  defect's level simply  by 6p(M+)  = dp(Mi') = -Sj@,,) [70].

t It  must also  be assumed that  there  is  a  high  density of  counterions.

+ This  corresponds  to  simple  statistics with  exhaustible number  of  states (cf. Fermi-Dirac).

possible if it can be  assumed that there  is a  charge-free zone characterized by a  moderate dielectric constant  between x = 0  and x = XA (see Chapter 3). The quantitative method  to  trace back Nis to true  standard  free enthalpy  is set  out  in  [3e,4] and in  more detail in  a  forthcoming  paper  1711 (see also  Ref.  [72]).

For the  following treatment  it suffices to  start from the  general form of Eq.  (11). However, it is necessary to  discuss the  problem of  the minority  charge  carrier [ 1  I J before  we turn  to  the  calculation of  the  conductivity contribution of  the  interface.

As discussed above,  the  concentration profile of  electronic charge  carriers in  ionic conductors  is also  determined by the  space  charge  potential 4 - $J~.  The space  charge  potential itself depends on the  charge  density and hence,  as  a  rule, on the  (mobile!) majority  charge  carriers. Again,  a  more detailed picture must include core  defect chemistry  [71]. Thus the  electron concentrations in  ionic conductors  are  determined  by the  interaction of  the  ions  with  the  interface (which  may  be  referred to  as  'fellow  traveller' effect). It  means  that  in  such  cases  the  electronic carrier concentration  is acid-base  controlled rather  than redox  controlled (direct interaction). This  yields in  our  example (n  stands  for  e'; p for  h')

Here,  as  for  Eq. (I  l), the  defect  chemical  equilibrium  conditions  have not been used explicitly, but  are  implicitly fulfilled [4]. In  particular the  constancy  of  the  chemical  potential of  the  neutral M  component  is assured  * . Equation (17) is  primarily of  significance for  semiconductors  such  as SnO2 and ZnO  and particularly for  their function  as  oxygen sensors t .

At this point  it is  worth establishing that  the  above relationships not only allow, in  principle, the  calculation of  defect  concentrations (together with  local and overall specific  onductivities) as a function  of x and T,  but  also  as  a function  of  the  component  activities (a~).  It  is, therefore, possible to  construct  Brouwer  diagrams  of  space  charge  layers. Recasting  Eq.  (11)  as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

we recognize  that  it is  first necessary  to  calculate the  activity dependence of  the  interfacial concentration (or  9). The bulk  values  (cf. also  A)  are  calculated as  usual  by application of  the  laws  of mass action  to  the  defect  reaction and the  interaction reaction with  a neighbouring  phase which fixes the  value  of  aM (e.g. parent  metal  electrode).

Figure  11  shows a  Brouwer diagram  calculated for  volume (thick lines) and boundary layers (thin lines, x=const.). For  the  sake  of  simplicity the  value  of  C,O (in contrast to  C'O or  cPo) is assumed to  be constant  here  (in the  sense of  the  Kliewer  approximation). The fact that the  Brouwer approximation (simplification of the electroneutrality equation by taking  account of various  majority  charge carrier pairs  in  various  activity ranges)  coincides  with the  approximations  with respect  to the concentration  necessary  for  the  validity of Eq. (1 l), is  a great  advantage for  the  calculations required. In  particular it can  be  seen  from Fig. 11 that in  regions of  very  high  and very  low  activity values  (when  such regions  are  indeed thermodynamically realizable) the  boundary  layer  defect concentrations approach the  volume values  at  a  constant  value  of  x (note  the  reduction  of  h as  a result of  increase in  the  volume concentration).

As in  the  volume it is also  possible to  represent the  'non-stoichiometry', i.e. the  detailed chemical composition,  as  a  function  of  @.$, T and in  this case  also  of  x.  Formulating  locally we have: [MI+,&amp;]~(')+. Differences between E  and 6 result from the  electronic charge  carrier concentrations. It is not  possible to  represent such  charged  non-stoichiometric compositions  in  conventional M-X  diagrams,  instead the  charged  particles have to  be included  as  constituents (e.g. for  E  = 6 :

*  PM c  P(M+)  + ~(e-1  = /.Ji + ~n = /.I: + &amp;  + RT In  NtNn  = $  + j&amp; + RT In  Ni,Nnm = Mtm + pnm  = ~IM~

t The  effects  resulting  from  the profile of ionic  defects  are evtdently  often neglected in  semiconductor physics.  Thus  the unexplained  finding that SnO2 functions well as an 02-sensor  (influence  on  [e']  in  the boundary zones) if  F--impurities are present (Fb) is  probably  a  result  of the increase in the electronic  defect concentration  (e')  in favour  of the ionic (Vo') 1731,  and  thus of an  increase of the redox  sensitivity.

The bulk values  (Ni,, A$,,  Ed) E  and 6 are  determined  by the  temperature  (K),  the  doping level and the  nature  of  the  neighbouring  phases  (UM,  9).

At the  end of Chapter 2.2  after the  discussion of conductivity contributions there  is  a more detailed investigation of  the  question  of  how  far  the  example of  a  specific defect  structure chosen here  (Frenkel  defect, monovalent defects) is capable  of  being  generalized.

Finally  mention  should be made  of the  interesting application to semiconducting systems  in which the  surface potential and the  volume defect chemistry  are  determined  by the  partial pressure of Oz.  Here too it is  possible to discuss Brouwer  diagrams for  boundary  layers: As an example depletion  layers at  SnOz  surfaces due to  absorbed oxygen (i.e. c = c(Po,;x))  are  considered  (see Appendix  2,  cf. also  the  next  chapter, [3e,4]).

## 2.2. Conductivity Contribution of  a  Single Interface

If we replace defect mole fractions (Ni,') by  molar  volume concentrations (ci,') (in dilute solutions there  is proportionality), then  the  conductivity profile W,,,(X) is obtained  by multiplication by the molar charge  and the  mobility  of  the  charge  carrier ui,v. For small  fields the  latter quantity  can be regarded  to  a  first approximation  as  independent  of  the  field and  will be  assumed to  be  independent of  position in  the  following  discussion (see, however,  Chapter 2.5). Recall  that as  the  /P-values, u is believed to  follow  roughly  a  step  function  behavior  (step between x = 0 and x = XA).

First let us  consider  Fig.  12. This  represents schematically a  thought  experiment  carried out  on an  AlzO$MX bicrystal; as  indicated the  geometry is infinite in  one  direction in  MX.  An interaction layer  (e.g. enrichment of M+)  is  accompanied  by a space  charge  zone (e.g. enrichment of M+vacancies). Integration of  the  conductivity profile from x = 0 into  the  bulk  (xmax  = d s+  A) gives the  conductivity contribution of  the  defect under consideration (v,i) parallel to  the  interface. This yields [6,9].

with  the  bulk  contribution  Yv,i, = dFu,,icv,i, and the  space  charge  contribution

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The result first given  in  Ref.  [3a,b,6] is  surprisingly simple  and can be formally  represented by an effective thickness of the  space  charge  zone (2h)  with  an effective concentration  (see  term in brackets).

The  total  parallel conductance is  given  by summation  over v,i and taking  into  consideration cell dimensions perpendicular  to  the  x direction that  were not  considered  in  the  definition of  Yl (multiplication by electrode height/electrode distance). For the  total space  charge  contribution to Yll  we obtain

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

With respect to  the  contribution to  the  measured (effective) specific onductivity

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

it should  be  remarked that -  as  can  later be  generalized -  AC&amp;!,  can  be  obtained  by  multiplication of the  mean  space  charge  conductivity, &amp;\_,  by the  volume  fraction of  the  interface (here: 43~  = 2h/d).  Additional  contributions (such  as  that  of  surface  conductivity) can be introduced  in  an analogous manner  (cf. Chapter 2.3). The values  @rv,i determined via  the  space  charge  zone are obtained  by comparison with  Eq.  (23).

For  the  sake  of  completeness  (cf., however,  Chapter  3,4)  we will also  include the  result that would be  obtained  by measurement  perpendicular to  the  interface, when the  field dependence of  mobility can be  neglected (This  is strictly speaking  only  guaranteed  for  small  electrical fields). As shown in Ref.  [9] integration over a(x)-' and neglecting the  depleted  counter-defect (e.g. i)  surprisingly * yield  an additive breakdown  of  the  form [9]

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

* ZA  stands  for  the  total 'background' value  which is  partly in  parallel with  the  interfacial contribution (!)

where Z is the  resistance multiplied by the  electrode dimensions. The space  charge  contribution is naturally negative  for  a  highly  conducting  interface (4,  &gt; 0)  and it comes to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Again the  additive form makes it simple  to  indicate the  space  charge  effect by normal resistance elements  and the  simple  form of  Eq.  (26) also  allows  an analysis into  the  (same)  effective thickness (2A)  and an effective charge  carrier concentration (here  a  different one naturally).

Also the  effective specific value  (A&amp;)  can be written in  the  form (Q)L&amp;).

For strong  depletion effects (9 -  1 and (1  + 4) 2  (Q/c~)'*)  Eq. (26)  simplifies to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  Chapter (2.6) explicit use  will be made  of  Eq. (27)  [19,74]. A more  detailed treatment  of  perpendicular  effects is given  in  Ref.  [75].

A priori the  assignment  of  the  factor  2 in  Eq. (22)  and Eq. (26) to  an effective length  and an effective concentration, respectively is arbitrary, but  appropriate for  the  following  reasons:

- (a)  Let  us  consider  ZI  and assume a  highly  conducting  boundary  layer (9 = I), so  then  we can interprete the  result Z*  = (d  2A)  /  (Fuc, ) in  such  a  manner  that the  thickness (2A)  falls out of  the  total balance.
- (b) It follows from Eq.  (11) that the  concentration profile for  effects that are  not  too  small (9  -  1) falls at  x = 2h to a good  approximation to  a small  value  of 1.7  cm,  independent of CO  (as opposed to  x = h). Therefore, 2h can  for  our  purposes  be  identified as  a  reasonable thickness of  the  space  charge  layer  [6].

Let  us  return  to  our own  problem and consider Eq. (23)  for  large effects and the  example of  an enrichment of  the  vacancies (9 -  1). The result is

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

i.e. the  effective concentration remains  simply  the  geometric  mean  of  bulk  and interfacial concentration. (The contribution AY!  is then -F(2h)uic,).

It  is necessary  to  take  account  of  the  influence of  the  counter-defects in  the  case  of  an  inversion effect, and for  large effects (9  1)  it is necessary  to  replace  uV&amp;$% by (u,w - uicm)  * .

If  the  phase boundary  effect is  basically a depletion effect then  Eq. (23)  becomes  (i designates the  defect in  question):

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  an analogous manner  to  the  majority  charge  carriers, when  9, -  1  Eq.  (17) yields

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

for  the  minority  charge  carriers [I I].

Equation (30b)  is  simplified for  large  effects in  the  case  of  n-conducting  space  charge  zones, becoming:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Even when  the  depletion effects are  negligible (second  term = 0)  Y$,, is still, in  contrast to  AYbn, a sensitive function  of  the  bulk  parameters  and thus  of  possible impurities (cf. Chapter 2.3.10) since  h a (c,,)'l*.

At this point  we will return to  the  effect of  different simplifications with  respect to  defect structure some of  which are  made  for  the  purpose of  illustration and some on principle.

*  Analogously i  should  be replaced by the  majority defect  in  the  case  of  an extrinsic sample.

- (1) The  assumption of unit  charge  for  defect  1  and 2 was not of  any importance.  In  the  case 1.~1 )  =  IQ{ q z e 1  it is merely  necessary to  replace  F by IzlF. The relationships only  become complicated  when  the  defects are  no longer  symmetrically  charged.
- (2) In  that  case  (1.~1 I  +  1221), the  relationships which refer to  both majority  charge  carriers must change (Eq.  (23)). But the  relationships for  large effects, in  which the  depleted  counter-defect (e.g. 2)  is neglected (Eq.  28)  remain  valid. The reason  lies in  the  fact that  Eq.  (27) can also  be derived  directly if the  contribution of  the  counter-defect (2) to  the  charge  density is neglected from the  start (see  Fig.  80,  Appendix  1). However  the  Debye  length  (cf. also  5)  then  has  a value  individually defined  for  the  majority  charge  carrier (1) *

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Equation (9)  can more generally be replaced  by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Both equations  agree  with  each other  in  the  approximations  for  large effects.

- (3) The example of  an  intrinsic Frenkel  defect compound  was  an  arbitrary choice. All  relationships also  apply  to  any defect pairs  (e.g. Schottky defects, ionic  and electronic defects, excess  and defect  electrons). Even the  setting up of  a  complete defect  equilibrium is  only  of  importance for  determining  the  bulk  (c,)  and interfacial concentrations (co) [4].

These conclusions are  very  important  in  this context, since if the  temperature  is not  too  high one of  the  majority  charge  carriers is  generally an impurity  defect. Thus at  the  limit of  large enhancement effects the  relationships are  also applicable to  the  extrinsic region, without  regard to  the  charge  (for instance divalent contamination  of  M+X-) of  the  substituting particles and (with  a certain loss  of  accuracy)  without  regard  to  the  mobility  (cf. Item 2).  As far  as  the calculation of  conductivity is concerned it is a  fortunate situation that the  impurity  level does not need to  be known  since c, in  Eq. (28)  disappears on account of  Eq. (31)  (cf., however, Chapter 2.3.10). It  is  nevertheless important that  the  major defect  1  be sufficiently mobile and that  immobilized profiles do not dominate.  If, however,  the  immobile impurity  defect determines  the  space  charge  density  (depletion effect), the  relationships change.

- (4) In  cases where there are  several charge  carriers at comparable concentrations (cf. the  analogous bulk  problem) it is no longer  possible to  analyse  the  basic  differential equation

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

in  the  above way.  Generally  however it  is possible, depending on the  situation, to  neglect as charge  carriers all except  two (oppositely charged)  species (cf. Brouwer approximation).

- (5) Limitations  and idealizations affecting the  basic  validity of the  above relationships will  be discussed in  Chapter 2.5.

Appendix  1  and in  particular Fig.  80 are  referred to for  an overview  of  the  quantitative relationships.

## 2.3. The Conductivity of  Two-phase  Mixtures  (MX:insulator)

## 2.3.1, General  relationships

It  is  naturally a much  more  complicated  problem to  calculate the  conductivity of  a  two-phase MX:insulator  mixture,  since it is necessary  to  take  the  distribution topology into  account.  We  are faced  with  a  complex superposition of  various  transport paths  (bulk, interface). If it were  desirable or  even  possible to  solve  this problem exactly, it would be  necessary to  know  the  exact  position of all pathways in  space  and the  solution would be much  too specific to  be of  general  interest. The

* On the other hand a common Debye length defined via the 'defect strength' can  be written for small defects [7].

Fig.  13. The highly  conducting  boundary layer of  an isolated A particle embedded  in MX only does not make  a perceptible contribution (a)  to  the  overall conductivity. The contribution is large  if continuous  paths  are  produced,  which occurs  even at  low A-concentrations  when  the particles coherently arrange  along  the  MX-grains (b)  [3].

solution would only  be applicable to  the  particular experiment  whose details it would scarcely be possible to  reproduce. As far  as  this problem is concerned it is necessary  to  simplify everything  as far  as  possible in  order  to  be able  to  make  general  statements without  deviating too much  from experimental  reality (see  Fig.  82,  Appendix  1). Thus it is  certainly realistic to  test the  predictions for  their sensitivity to  the  model.

In  the  literature two sophisticated methods are  generally applied to  solve such  transport problems in  heterogeneous  media [76]:

- (a) The  percolation theory,  that  yields threshold  values  at  which the  behaviour of  the system changes qualitatively (e.g. the  appearance of  continuous  paths)  and that  investigates microscopically the behaviour for  other  distributions particularly in  the  neigbourhood  of these threshold  levels.
- ('4 The effective medium  theory, in  which the  particles are  embedded  in  a  continuous  'effective medium'  whose parameters  have  to  be  chosen in  a  self-consistent way.

A range of  investigations have  been reported  in  the  literature, in  which these  theories have  been applied  to  our problem with  the  assumption of  random  distribution of  both phases  in  order  to make  the  problems amenable to  treatment  [58,62-641. Even though it will be demonstrated below that  such  random  distribution is not  realized in  practical experiments  (in contrast to  MX:MX' in Chapter 3), these  results nevertheless serve to  check  the  flexibility of the  relationships given  below.

As can be seen from  Fig.  13a a highly  conducting boundary  layer  that  can form round an isolated particle scarcely affects the conductivity  (blockage  of transport  by poorly conducting matrix material). However, if  continuous  paths  are  formed  (i.e. situation above the  percolation threshold) then  their contribution is large (Fig. 13b).

The  model  chosen for  the following  treatment  is  a symmetrical,  three-dimensional network (simple  cubic symmetry)  of percolating paths (see  also  Fig.  14).  As can be seen immediately all components  lying  perpendicularly in  equipotential surfaces cancel  out on average, while  the remainder can be regarded  as  being  combined  to  a  single volume as  far  as  their electrical effect is concerned since they  are  connected  in  parallel. Neglecting finite 'transfer resistances' (see Chapter 2.3.2) it follows  that

where a, is the  specific mean  conductivity of  the  possible transport regions (o( = L d space  charge zone (whereby the  bulk  portion  is subtracted  as  background),  o(  = MX 4 bulk  (that extends  up to the very interface at  x = 0 as  background), LY  = A  ?  second phase,  o(  = w  2 interaction layer  (possibly also  third  phase)), /Ia  is  a factor  that  measures the  fraction of the  volume  that

Taking into  account blocking effects as  a result of perpendicular  portions  of  the  network (lying in  the  equipotential surfaces) and including capacitative effects, a  relationship is found for  the  complex conductivity 0 $ [9]

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

that  will be particularly useful  for  the  discussion of  grain  boundary  phenomena The corresponding  equivalent circuit diagram is also  reproduced in  that  chapter. (see  Chapter 4).

The above model  is not  just mathematically  simple, since to  a  first approximation it is  possible to neglect  @/QL (see  below) and an analytical treatment  becomes  possible, it  is  also  a good representation of  reality even  at  surprisingly low volume fractions as  can  be  seen  from optical and electron micrographs (Fig.  14). The situation is  also  compatible  with  EDX and Auger maps. The reason  for  the  formation  of  continuous  paths  has  its origin in  preparative-'kinetic' phenomena  but above all in  the  nature  of  the  interactions at  the  interface (cf. Chapter 2.3.7) and in  the  smallness of  the  A1203 grains  (typically: O.Ol-  0.5  pm)  with  respect to  the  grain  size of  the  ionic  conductor (l-100  pm). It  is easily estimated  that  under certain circumstances very  small  proportions  (-  Iv/o) of A1203  are  adequate to completely coat  all ionic  conductor grains. Then, the  distribution is like a brick-layer model  where the  grain-boundaries are  filled with  coherent  A1203-particles. Eq. (35)  is  a quantitative description of  the  complex  conductivity in  a brick-layer model  which also includes  space charge effects (first given  in  Ref.  [9]). The  situation also  resembles  a wetting  of grains by a  fluid. At the  first glance  it may  appear that  Eq. 34  may  only  be valid at  a  certain Q)Avalue  or a very restricted PA-range. This,  however,  is  not the  case. Rather,  in  each preparation process  via  the  melting  method  the  final morphology is  determined anew  and a change in  the A-content can produce a change in  the  morphology such that  a further  increase of  the  volume fraction results in  a  decrease  of  the  AgCl  grain  size. Thus more  or  less coherent  monolayers are

formed * . Only at  very  large q-values  the  monolayer  situation must be given  up,  agglomeration of  Al203 and thus  blocking  effects occur (see  Fig.  14  bottom, rhs). Some  minor blocking  effects already  occur at  moderate o+values. Those  effects can be separated  by impedance  spectroscopy (see next  chapter)  and can be attributed to  the  increasing density  of  the  particle arrangement.  An ordered distribution (interfacial interactions!) and consideration of the  actual  size  relationships reduce  the  first percolation threshold  (formation  of  continuous  paths) drastically t  (in comparison with  a typical IO%1  for  random  distribution and particles of  comparable size). It  is also  possible to  apply  Eq.  (34) to  a  pore  model, that comes close  to  reality under certain circumstances  at  high Al203 levels and which assumes that  the  ionic conductor fills the  pores  of  the  Al203 matrix  [39]. On  account of the  drastic differences in  the  a,-values, Eq. (34)  is  of  utility even in  the  case  of very low Al203 concentrations  (the  region  of isolated particles) and especially in  the  region  of very  high  concentrations (region  of  blocked  paths) (&amp;??/L@L  +: 0,  see  below).  In  this sense  such  a picture describes a  most favorable situation (quasi-parallel switching). A higher  degree  of  isolated particles owing to specific preparational or geometrical  conditions, or owing to a low surfacesurface interaction leads  to  lower  enhancement effects and to  situations that  are  only  accessible by more sophisticated descriptions [S&amp;62,64]  (see  Chapter 2.3.3).

As will  be described  individually the  above relationship also  makes  it  possible to  explain  the impedance spectra, and the  concentration, particle size and temperature  dependencies  in  a  satisfactory  manner. Because it describes the  maximum realistic effect Eq. (34) is naturally fundamental if the  aim is to  optimize  the  conductivity in  regard  to  this two-phase  effect. Other distributions not described by Eq.  (34) are  unfavourable with  respect to  conductivity. When  we use  this simple  model for  calculations in  the  following  discussion we can even  apply  it with  adequate  approximation  for a  result derived  from linear geometry,  Eq. (28).

Neglecting  the  conductivity of  the  insulator phase  we obtain  [3,6]

The first term describes the  conductivity attributable to  the  bulk, and the  last term,  that we will neglect in  what follows, represents the  contribution from newly produced migration  mechanisms (actually surface  conductivity, conductivity in  the  interaction layer, in  any boundary  phase etc.) (qW  &lt;  PA). The middle term (&amp;,I\_) describes the  important  contribution from the  space  charge zone.

Here flA  is the  ratio of  the  surface to  the  volume of  the  isolating phase.  As a  result of  a  degree of  uncertainty  concerning the  structure and density  of y-Al203 in  particular it  is  advantageous for  practical purposes  to  express  ~AL!A  in  terms  of  the  (experimentally accessible) specific massrelated surface  (G?;), the  mass of  the  oxide  and the  volume  of  the  sample.  flA = 3/rA  when  the particles are  spherical in  shape.  In  all cases  BL accounts  for  the  surface that  does not take  any part  in  the  conductivity effect. If  a  sufficiently large interfacial effect is  assumed (~'0 &gt;  coo), then 2c,9,/  (I-  9,)  becomes approximately  (C,OC, ) 'I2 and 2c,  9,/ ( 1  + 9,)  approximately  cbJ. The purely space  charge  term simplifies to

As can be seen  the  last term accounts  for  depletion  effects with  respect to  the  conductivity, but these  are  only  important  when  the  mobility of  the  depleted  species is very  much  greater than  that of  the  enriched  species (Ui/uv -X  cto/c$). If  this is not  the  case  we obtain  with  &amp; = 1

## 2.3.2. Impedance  spectra  (frequency dependence)

Typical  curves  of  the  complex impedance $ and the  reciprocal complex capacitance  $ [4] 0 0 are  reproduced in  Fig.  15  for  a  two-phase AgCl : Al203 mixture. The analysis reveals that  the  high frequency  branch is determined by the  high-conductivity paths  short-circuiting the  bulk,  whereas to  a rough approximation the  associated capacity  is that  of  the  bulk.  This result is  in  complete agreement with  the  use  of  the  quasi-parallel switching or  brick-layer model (Eq.  (34)) [4,9] since considering capacitive elements  in  the  general  Eq. (35) leads  to:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Eq. (39) is  also  approximately  valid for  a  random  distribution. This  (i.e. the  assumption of  percolating paths) is supported  by  the  Monte  Carlo  simulations of  Blender  and Dieterich [77] on random AC  networks,  where appreciable deviations from the  bulk  permittivity of  the  ionic conductor only occurred  in  the  neighbourhood  of  the  percolation thresholds (cf. also  Chapter 2.3.3).

The corresponding  equivalent circuit diagram is to  be  found in  Chapter  4  (Fig. 48). The low frequency effects reveal some (minor)  blocking  effects even  in  the  regime  of  quasi-parallel-switching. This  may  be attributed to  the  increasing density of  the  AlzOs-arrangement representing a  perpendicular hindrance  for  the  (parallel) interfacial transport by narrowing  the  current paths  and giving rise to  an  additional impedance characterized by a  higher  capacitance. This  situation is analogous to  a  bad-contact-situation [16,78,79]. In  the  transition to  the  blocking regime  the  second  semicircle

* In  hot-press composites  the  grains are  much  larger and blocking  effects occur  earlier (see  Fig.  14, top). Note that  for the  purpose of  illustration in  Fig.  14  bottom r.h.s. a large grain  situation is  displayed.

t Two-phase systems  with  very  low percolation thresholds have  however been described in  the  literature (see  R2).

increases and the  relaxation times  of  the  two branches  approach each  other. In  the  proper  blocking regime  mostly one depressed  large semicircle remains. This  transition is predominantly influenced by the  density  of  the  A1203 arrangement and the  formation  of  multiple layers, aggregates and so on. It  is  worth noting  that, in  the  regime of  quasi-parallel-switching, the  a-values  used for  the evaluation  correspond to the  high frequency  semicircle; nevertheless also  the  effective d.c. conductivity which also  includes the  blocking  effects is usually drastically enhanced compared  to  the AlzOs-free  sample.  An  attempt  to  extract further information  from the  high  frequency  semicircle on the  defect  concentrations is given  in  Ref.  [80].

## 2.3.3. Dependence on  volume fraction

Equation (36)  immediately explains  the  proportionality of a,  to the  Al203 volume  fraction for  LiI : Al203 (displayed in  Fig.  1). Figure 16  reveals that  similar relationships hold for  AgBr [8a]. Similar characteristics have  been  found for  CuCl, AgCl and TIC1  [3,4,32,33,81]. Naturally  the approximate proportionality to  volume fraction does  not  apply  over  the  whole 43  range  under all circumstances. At very  low concentrations it must be primarily isolated particles that  are  present, that  express themselves  in  lower  conductivities (formally lower, but  VA-dependent  &amp;values).  Here it  is  relevant to apply the  percolation  or effective medium description. Blocking effects appear at  very  high  concentrations, where insulator particles block  the  conductivity paths, the  insulating effect of  Al203 makes itself felt and jl falls rapidly when Eq.  (34) is formally  applied. The retention of Eq. (34)  is  not merely formal in  nature  but also  useful, particularly for  the  case  of  blocking effects, when  discussing T-dependence, since the  effective &amp;factors are  almost  independent  of  the temperature  on account  of  the  extremely  small  oA/o,,,L ratio. It must be  mentioned again  that the rough validity of  the  simple  proportionality is maintained  by a  decrease  of  the  ionic  conductor's grain  size when  the  volume  fraction is increased.

Here,  it is  also  worth saying  a  word  to  the  curved relationship given  by Jow and Wagner  [32] a,,, CC  p/ ( 1  - cp)  . The curvature  due to  (1  - q) is an artefact of  the  calculation which is performed with  the  apriori neglect  of  the  AlzO3-volume, i.e. 47  K  1  or  a,,, x 43. If  we repeat the  calculation by taking  account of  the  AlzOs-volume, we obtain  a,,, 0~  q/(1 - Q, + v,)  = 43. The morphological model published  recently [82] by Uvarov et  al. is in  general  identical to  the  approach used  in  this work [3]. The authors  also  gave  some interesting explicit examples for  'non-ideal'  distributions.

Figure  17a  provides  a schematic  picture of  a  a,,, - Q)A  characteristic over  the  whole range. The extent  of  the  various  regions  depends on the  experimental  conditions, i.e. on the  type,  size  and concentration  of  the  phases  involved  and on the  preparative details. A  distinction can be made

The occurrence  of  various  regions (isolated particles, continuous  paths, blocking  effects) in  a  u,,, - QI*  characteristic and specific  ases  depending on the  conditions (exp. examples from the  top  LiI : A1203,  AgCl : Al2O3;  LiBr : AlzO3,  /3-AgI :  'fly ash';  B-AgI :  A1203, AgCl : SiO2 [1,6,35,45]) (see  text).

## between the  following  extreme cases:

When  continuous paths  are  formed very early  (promoted by favourable  interfacial effects and rA  values  small  in  comparison with  the  grain  size of  the  ionic conductor)  it is to  be  expected  that there  will be an extension  of  the  quasi-parallel circuit region  (Fig.  17b), however here  percolation thresholds  can be masked  by small  homogeneous doping effects (see  Chapter 2.5.3) that  are  of importance at  low VA  levels. A concave increase is likely (Fig.  17~) if  isolated particles still continue to  occur  in  the  high  concentration range  (large particles, low surface-surface interaction, unfavourable  distribution such  as  random  distribution, see  below);  a  convex shape  (Fig. 17d)  ought to  be  obtained  if a  blocking  effect is significant very  early (small particles and unfavourable  distribution). All  these  patterns are  to  be  found in  the  literature (see figure legends). Such unfavorable morphologies can easily be realized by hot  pressing (see  Fig.  14  top).

Naturally  a concave initial characteristic ought also  to be realized if  random  distribution is assumed. This is  confirmed by the Monte  Carlo simulations of Bunde, Dieterich  and Roman [62,63,76]. Figure  18  describes a  typical situation in  two dimensions  [63]; as  can  be seen  percolating  paths  are  formed but  the  greater part  of  the  highly  conducting  regions  still remains  isolated. Quantitative comparisons are  not possible here,  particularly since  it has been assumed  that  the particle sizes are  identical and that  the  boundary  layer  is homogeneously  conducting.  The qualitatively similar behaviour  of  o,,,(Q)A) also  follows from the  effective medium  theory  [58] (cf. Fig. 1)  (see also  Chapter 3).

The  assumption of a completely regular  arrangement of equi-distant second-phase particles yields a similar curve  that  is naturally displaced towards  lower  conductivity [65].

A  further  topological model, namely the  pore model  of Poulsen and Moller [39], appears  to approach reality closely at  high  values of  Q)A  in  particular, as  Auger scanning  investigations carried out  by us  have  revealed.

The rather fractal character of  the  surface of  y-  (also r~-) Al203 on a  larger scale can be  approximately  accounted for  by the  use  of  BET  surface density calculations. Extremely narrow fjords, that are  to  be  expected  on  account  of  a  certain self similarity of  the  structure and which are  not  detected by BET  measurements, are  also  likely to  be  short-circuited as  a  result of  the  nano-size effects to  be expected  (cf. Chapter 2.5.3). It  is certain, however,  that the  surface determined  by gas  adsorption will not  be  precisely identical with, but  rather larger than  the  contact  surfaces accessible to  the  melt.

## 2.3.4. Dependence on particle  size

As we were able  to  demonstrate  for  AgCl  and AgBr  [3,8a] a,,, is approximately  proportional to RA  (BET  method).  The values of  effective radii using  y-Al203 (Meller, rA  = 0.03ym) are  calculated from aA. The effective value  is in  very  good agreement  with  the  geometrical radius  @A  = 0.15pm) in  the  case  of Al203 (Fluka)  that, according  to  our results and according  to  the  manufacturer, contains  96%  a-Al203 but  possesses -  like pure  y-Al203 -  a  large number of  surface OH  groups. A proportionality such  as  is required  by Eq. (38) was also  found here.

Fig.  20.  The  effective activation energy of enhanced conductivity in  (heavily) heterogeneously doped (cation) electrolytes vs.  bulk  migration  enthalpy  of  cation  vacancy  [14].

In the case of LiI-Al203 Poulsen and Mraller [39]  also  found a proportionality between the effective conductivity and the  specific surface  area  of  the  oxide  (see Fig.  19). Comparable  results have been described  by J.B. Wagner  et  al. [32,46]. Of course  this most simple  relationship is  not always  maintained,  for  the  reasons  given  above (see  [24]).

## 2.3.5. Temperature  dependence

Whereas the  above parameters  basically only  affect the  formation  of  continuous  paths, the  temperature dependence ought  to  tell us  something  about  the  mechanism  on which  the  increased interfacial conductivity  is based.  The temperature  dependence is mainly  composed  of  the  temperature dependence of  the  mobility  and of  the  concentration of  the  dominant charge  carrier types  in  the space  charge  zone at x = 0.  For  the  quasi-parallel switching region  and for  sufficiently high  second phase  contents  Eq. (38)  yields [6,13]:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As has  been demonstrated experimentally and is understandable from the  above discussion EJ\_ the same value  is also  expected  to  be  measured in  the  blocked  region  (resulting in  a  parallel shifting; #I &lt; B(ideal); afl/aT =  0) [8a] (see below,  Fig.  25). This  was recently also  confirmed by computer experiments  for  random  distribution [64] (see also  Ref.  [79]).

The relative change in  the  charge  carrier concentration on temperature  change should  be small when  there  are  strong  interactions. If  a  Kliewer-Khhler-type model is  taken  as  an approximation then  it follows  that

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The formation  term is obtained  from half the  standard enthalpy  that  is necessary to  create defect j  by  charge  transfer from the  bulk  to  the  interface (AjHi (cf. Eq.  (R3a)  and Eq.  (R3b)). This  value  is reduced  by the  (negative) interaction enthalpy  (AH&amp;)  with  respect to  the  (positive and)  comparably small  enthalpy  of  formation  with  reference to  a  free surface (AH&amp;)  [6], and thus  negligible to  a  first approximation.  The  reader  is  referred to  the  next  chapter  for  a  more  quantitative discussion. In

addition the  above  model requires supplementings  by  several additional correction terms  as  a  result of  the  electrical potential and the  limited number  of  interfacial sites. If  the  plausible assumption is made  that A,Hi  &gt; 0 then  this latter effect in  particular should  lead  to  an additional reduction of -Rf$F (cf. 'saturation effect' in  Chapter 2.3.6). Hence, to a reasonable  approximation we obtain  * for  a  large effect

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

It  is  important to note that  Eq. (42)  also  holds  for  a frozen  interfacial concentration  (frozen 'degree of influence'). The  independence of the concentration  term from temperature is  also supported  by Ref.  [80].

The above finding  now  explains in  a  very  simple  manner  the  result presented  at  the  start (see Fig.  5)  and again  plotted in  Fig.  20,  namely that  the  activation energy  of  conductivity of  all the examples  cited there approximately  approaches  (generally slightly higher) the  enthalpy  of  migration of the cation  vacancies. This not only supports  the  model  of 'heterogeneous  doping', it  also reveals that  cations are  evidently stabilized (internally adsorbed)  at  the  interface in  all the  cases cited in  Fig.  20  and that the  vacancies produced as  a  result of  this reaction are  responsible for  the increased charge  carrier transport. The slight deviation in  Fig. 20  may be  explained by the  neglected formation  contribution. Reference  should  be  made  to  Chapter  2.3.7 with  regard  to  experiments  on semiconductors,  melts  and aqueous systems, that  confirm  this mechanism  (cf. also  the  discussion of  the  influence of  the  interfacial activity of  the  second  phase).

It should  be  added that according  to  Eq.  (36) the  remaining  bulk  contribution to  the  conductivity at  high  temperatures  is  slightly less than the  conductivity of  the  pure phase and that  this brings about the  (slight) parallel shift in  the  (Tvs. T-curves  that  follow. In  addition  it can be seen  from the  form of  Eq.  (38) that  all curves  for  different PA  values should  intersect at  a  common a-T-point (a* = Bc&amp;o).

## 2.3.6. Experiments on AgCl and AgBr: quantitative description

In  order  to  obtain  information  concerning  absolute values  detailed experiments  have  been carried  out on AgCl  and AgBr, for  which all the  necessary  data  are  available [3,6,8,81]. Figure  21 shows results for  AgCl : Al203 (13v/o, 0.15  pm , Fluka) as  a  function  of  temperature. The typical conductivity  increase at  low temperatures  is  evident. The bulk  effect predominates at  higher temperatures, the  conductivity is merely  slightly reduced  with  respect to  that of  the  pure  ionic conductor on account of  the  'lost volume'  (second  phase)  (cf. (1  - qA)U, in  Eq. (38)). If  now  the assumption is  made  that  the  interface at  x = 0 is  saturated with  charge  carriers (Ag+ vacancies) -  maximum effects of  this type  are  not  unknown  for  electronic charge  carriers [83] and have  been discussed for  the  grain  boundaries  of  ionic ceramics  [84,85] -,  this allows  the  calculation of  the conductivity of  the  two-phase  mixture  without  the  use  of  an adjusting parameter.  Here it should be noted that  strictly speaking  such an assumption goes  beyond  the  limits of  the  model  (Boltzmann  distribution!) (see also  Chapter 2.5.2). As can  be  seen  from Fig. 2la,  in  which the  calculated maximum contribution is indicated, this starting point  leads to  a  surprisingly good agreement  with the  experiment  -  considering the  crudity of  the  model.  If now  the  bulk  contribution is taken  into account  according  to  Eq.  (36) together with  a  (very weak) temperature  dependence of  ~'0, then  it is possible to  produce an accurate  description of  the  conductivity curve  over  the  whole temperature range  (Fig. 21b).  Figure  22  demonstrates  that  this applies to  other  concentrations in  the  nonblocking  range  and for  various  particle sizes. The curve  drawn in  for  a  homogeneously  doped material reveals the  principal differences and analogies discussed in  Chapter 2.3.9.

The experimental results obtained  with AgCl : Al203 (different volume fractions, different particle sizes) by another  research group (Khandkar  and Wagner [33]) can also be quantitatively described by  this relationship [33,6] (Fig. 23). For  a  more detailed discussion of  the  effects in  the  polycrystalline halide  the  reader  is referred to  Chapter 4.

* The situation is somewhat  more complicated  in  the  case  where the  counter-defect is  of  importance  (see TICI); however, for  sufficiently large effects the  exact  relationship reduces  to  Eq.  (42).

Fig.  21.  Quantitative analysis of  an AgCl : Al203 sample (rA  = 0.15~,  $A  = 13%) [6]. (a)  Absolute calculation of the space charge contribution assuming a saturation effect (-: /?L = 0.5; - - -: BL = 1). (b)  If  the  bulk  contribution is  included  it is  possible to  fit the  curve perfectly by only  assuming a slight T dependence of  co.

The experiments  on AgBr  [8a] can  be  understood  in  an  analogous  manner. Here too  the  assumption  of  a  saturation effect makes it possible to  describe the  absolute value  of  the  total conductivity as  a  function  of  temperature, specific surface area  and concentration of  the  second  phase  (Fig. 24).

The  blocking  region  reveals itself particularly by a reduction  in  the  conductivity in  the  high temperature  regime. In  agreement  with  the  discussion above  the  a,,,(T) curves  in  Fig. 25  are  subject to  parallel displacement  (Chapter  2.3.3, 2.3.5). Accordingly it  is  possible to  take  account of  the number  of  blocked conductivity paths  by reduced  T-independent p-values. Such blocking  effects also  appear at  low temperatures  (see Fig.  26b), thus  Fig. 26 also  displays the  blocking  of  the  bulk pathways where a  separation of  series and parallel effects is not  possible due  to  the  high  impedances involved.

The temperature  dependence of  C,O that was  introduced  as  a  fitting parameter  -  to  obtain  better agreement between theory and experiment -  is  very small  in  all cases. It  amounts  to ca.  0.06 eV in  our  experiments  with  AgCl:AlzOs; it is ca.  0.00-0.02 eV in  the  published  measurements  on AgCl:Al203  as  it is  for  our measurements  on AgBr:AlzOj. It  would be stretching the  model too far  to  interpret precisely the  slight differences in  the  case  of  AgCl. A  thermodynamic  discussion on the  basis of  the  Kliewer  model is included  below even  though it is not  possible to  rule out  that the  very  low activation energy  of  C,O  is the  result of  a  frozen-in interfacial interaction. Although this model is not strictly speaking  adequate, as  is demonstrated in  Chapter 2.1  (particularly in  the

case  of large  effects), for  the  thermodynamic  description of the  interface, it  will be used in  the following  in  order  to  provide  a  feeling for  the  effects that  occur  and to  provide  a  semiquantitative comparison with  published  work relating to  the  'free'  surface.

In  the  case  of  AgCl  we find  a  great  deal  of  scatter in  the  literature for  a  'free'  surface  (R2a) [86,87,14] (see  Chapter 2.3.6).

If  we estimate  a value  for  A,Hi from the  difference between -W2)aln cvol al/T  and h, and a value  for  A&amp; from the  absolute value  (Chapter  2.35)  then  for  the  enthalpy and entropy  of  the  interfacial interaction we obtain  reasonable values  of  the  order  of  [6]:

which are  consistent with appreciable bonding. Less reliable data  are  available for  AgBr, but a first estimate  [8a] leads  to  comparable results (-  (0.05. . . 1)  eV and ( 10e4.. . 10m3)  eV/K),  which is not unexpected in  view of  the  similarity of  the  crystallography and defect  chemistry  of  the  two phases.  More  reliable data  should  be available from thin  film  data  and tracer profile experiments [lOb,89,126]. Evaluating  these  results leads  to a significant discrepancy  in  the entropy values. However, the  discussion about  the  nature  of  the  majority  carriers in  the  thin film experiments  is not yet  finished [71] (see Chapter 6). It has  already  been emphasized that the  agreement  in  the  absolute value  may  be  somehow  accidental in  view  of  the  approximations  involved. One approximation  not yet  mentioned, is the  continuity of  the  concentration  function. Strictly speaking  the  distribution is  discrete on an atomistic level. This leads  to  the  fact  that  the  actual  maximum effect may  be

greater than assumed above:  Following  Eq. (38)  the  mole number  of  adsorbed particles per  area is  (2E@TV;'F-*) *'* in  the  case  of  a  maximum effect. A rough estimate of  the  same quantitity in  the  case  of  a  monolayer  is  simply ( V$VA)-'~ which may  be up to  a factor of 10  larger. Thus the  first expression  is not strictly an upper limit (see Chapters  2.5.3 and 5).

## 2.3.7. The defect-inducing interfacialprocess.

Attempts have been made  to  modify the  interfacial activity of  the  second  phase [3,8a] in  order to obtain  further information  concerning  the  interfacial effect and the  defect-inducing step. For this purpose investigations have  been  carried out  to  elucidate: a)  the  different influences of  various oxides, b)  the  differing effects of  various modifications of  a  given  oxide  such  as  Al203,  c)  the  effect of  chemical  modifications of  the  surface of  a  given  oxide  modification (Y-Al2O3).

In a first exercise two-phase mixtures  containing  o(-  Al203 that  had been heated to a very high  temperature  (&gt; 1200°C)  were investigated [8a]. In  accordance  with  the  carefully carried  out preparation  and the  conditions employed it had to  be  assumed,  in  accordance  with  the  literature, that  the  interfaces were free  from the  OH groups that  normally coat  the  surface of  most oxides. The absence  of  a  marked two-phase  effect (see also  [36]) points  to  the  importance of  these  surface groups [8a].

Zhao et  al. [48] have  reported  that different modifications of  A1203 exert different effects. In  order to  obtain  more reliable information  we modified  the  surface of  Al203 by  reaction with  (CH3)3SiCl:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As is well  known  the  nucleophilic effect should  be  greatly reduced  by shielding of  the  lone  pairs of electrons of  the  OH  group.  A difficulty of  principle should  be  pointed  out  here: Changing the  surface activity and,  hence,  the  interactions naturally alters the  distribution topology  too. This  is also  true for  the  above-mentioned experiments  with  ~~-Al203. However, the  blocking  effects occuring  due to a  non-favorable  distribution are  particularly evident  above  in  the  high  temperature  behavior. Thus, by parallel-switching the  graph  in  Fig. 27  (see previous  chapter) we can  approximately  deconvolute

the  two effects. This indicates that  the  use  of  Al203 pretreated in  such  a  manner  visibly reduces the  local conductivity effect and,  hence, the  surface activity. A large reduction  of  the  effect is also observed  when AgBr  is the  ionically conducting  matrix.

An analogous  result is brought  about  in  the  system  LiI:A1203, by  the  use  of  Al203 whose surface protons  have  been exchanged for  Li+  by reaction with  CH3Li:

This pretreatment  causes  a reduction  of the  effect in  both LiI  and AgBr. The  intrepretation, however,  is not that  clear  since different partially counteracting effects are  possible: They  include an increase  of  cation  activity of the  surface, size effects, increase of  basicity, structural changes ('Li20',  LiOH')  etc.

Experiments with SiOz (small  effect) and  MgO (large effect, if  not reaction) *  support the conclusion  that the  activity falls as  the  acidity of  the  HO-M group is reduced.  In  addition but  not independent of  this evidently, however,  the  OH groups are  of  fundamental importance (whether formulated  as  adsorbed Hz0 or  as  functional OH  groups). The often  observed  effect of  water  on LiI  ought probably  to  be  mentioned too  in  this context  [36,37].

While  these experiments  are  affected by  the  inherent uncertainty concerning  distribution topology (tendency to agglomeration), the  results of our wetting  experiments  at  least with respect  to an AgCl  melt  -  provide  clear evidence  concerning  interfacial activity (Figs. 29-31). While in  the case  of  polycrystalline a-Al203 the  surface  interaction in  contact  with  a silver chloride  melt is small  and,  a  finite wetting  angle  can  be observed  after solidification, the  surfaces of  y-Al203 and MgO are  completely  wet.  The melt  also  readily penetrates the  pores  (see Fig.  29  left). In  the  case of  polycrystalline SiOz (see  Fig.  29  right) the  melt  has  in  accordance  with  the  acidity -  little tendency to  wet (Fig.  29 right). Similar  results are  obtained  with  chemically  pretreated samples.

* The experiments  with MgO suggest  a local reaction to  AgzO/Ag.

The black  coloration in  Fig. 29  is a  result of  the  illumination. (On account  of  the  elevated electronic concentration  the  rate of  reduction  is probably  raised in  the  case  of  a  surface-active substrate.)

Experiments with defined  crystallographic surfaces indicate an interaction of the  cation  with oxygen. If  AgCl  is fused  on the  basal  plane  surface  of  corundum,  where the  (partially covalent) oxygen atoms basically form the  surface, then  after solidification the  angle  of  contact  is ca.  4S',

while  it is much  higher  (ca. 90')  in the  case of  the  prism  plane  surface (Figs. 30,3 1 left). (In  the  plan view  the  solidified drops  reveal the  hexagonal  symmetry  (Fig. 30  right) and the  two-fold  symmetry (Fig.  30 right) that  mirror  the  crystallographic planes.) The  same diversity of surface  activity is also  met in  the  thin-film experiments  described in  Chapter 6.

Recently [88], accurate  in-situ measurements  of the  wetting  angle  and the  interfacial tension between liquid AgCl  and different crystallographic planes  of  a-Al203 have been performed as  a function  of  temperature. The results show the  strongest interaction for  the  (1000) plane  (see Table I). Structure  calculation performed by Tasker [89] reveal  negatively charged regions  that  really invite the  cation  to  be  adsorbed here  (Fig. 31). Interestingly, at  very  high  temperature  the  melting behavior  is  determined by the  interaction entropy (see  Table  I)  that  shows a ranking  inverse to that  of  the  enthalpy  (as  also  obvious from Fig.  31).  (The latter finding  is  less interesting in  this context, but of  significance for  the  sinter theory  [28].) In  agreement with  the  observations in  the composites,  immediate spreading  is observed  if humidity is not carefully removed.

Consequently we formulate  our defect-inducing mechanism  as  follows (see  Fig.  33).

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Nu  stands  for  a nucleophilic surface  group such as  an OH group that  adsorbs  the  cation. Since we are  involved  with  space  charge  phenomena the  oxonium  group -OHM+ formed in  the  case of  an OH-group does not of  course  have to  give  up the  proton.  It is  worthy of  note  that  -0Hf groups have been discussed in  a completely  analogous manner  in  colloid and sensor  chemistry (pH ISFETs) for  contact  with  aqueous medium  at  high  proton activities. In  this context  too  there are  very  similar orders  of  oxide  activity ((y-AlzO3)  &gt; (SiO2)  &gt; ((Y-AlzO3)) that express themselves in  corresponding  zero  charge  pH  values  (e.g. pH'(y-AlzOs)  = 9;  pH'(SiO2) = 3 [90,91]). It  will certainly be worthwhile to  vary the  surface  acidity by the  formation  of  mixed crystals of Al203 and SiO2.

The interfacial effects, described  briefly in  Chapter 2.4, 2.6,4, and 5  provide  a  strong  confirmation  of  the  defect-inducing reaction  formulated. In  particular the  effects of  basic  gaseous  species (Chapter  5)  are  analogous  to  those  of  the  OH-groups.

An intensive search  of  the  literature has  led  us  in  the  meanwhile to  examples of  surface interactions of  oxides  such  as  Al2O3,  SiO2  and metakaolinite with  melts  or  aqueous solutions of  AgNOs, LiNOs  and CuClz, which also  support  the  above mechanism  [92-95l.A  discussion of  the  application  of  further techniques  is given  in  Chapter 2.5.4.

It  has  still not been clarified to  what extent  the  method  of  preparation  produces OMt groups (implying the  formation  of  HX)  in  addition to  OHM+ groups. On the  one  hand,  it is always  possible to  detect  traces -  or  in  the  case  of  undried  oxides  significant amounts too  -  of  gaseous  HX  (or X2 when X = I, instability of  HI!), that are  attributable to  a  simple  acid  base  reaction; on the  other hand,  in  the  case  of  dried  oxides there  is no difference detectable from the  thermal  reaction of  the pure ionic  conductor in  (moist) air. Acid is  evolved  to  a  limited degree  in  the  case  of  the  system AgNOs:AlzOs even  at  temperatures well  above the  melting  point  [93].

## 2.3.8. Experiments  with  TlCl:  influence of  the  counter-defect.

We  are  now  in  a  position to  discuss the  various  equilibrium cases possible in  terms  of  the  defect type  and the  degree  of  mobility  between the  metal  ion  vacancy and the  counter-defect [3d].

If, as  in  the  case  of  Schottky  defect, LiI  (u(V,') &gt; u(Vr')) the  conductivity is determined by the metal  vacancy,  then  the  simplest possibility, namely a  continuous  increase in  the  total conductivity, is  realized if  the  mechanism  under consideration is  valid  (Fig.  34 top).  In  the  case  of Frenkel defect  silver halides the  counter-defect (u(Ag;) is more mobile (u(Agi') &gt; u(V,g')). For this reason significant heterogeneous  doping  (with 4, &gt; 0)  must pass through  a  minimum value  of  conductivity, corresponding  to  an ionic  P-N  transition (here: V-I  junction) analogous to  the  p-n  transition of semiconductors (cf. Fig.  34  center). Indications for  such  ionic p-n  transitions have  been described for  the  system  PbO/ZrOz in  [96]. If  there  is homogeneous  doping by cations of  higher  valence  as  is to  be actually expected  in  the  lower  temperature  range  -  then  the  upper profile is  relevant once again  (#(Vi,)  &gt; u(N&amp;)). The analogous  case  for  Schottky  defects is  found in  TlCl which is intrinsically a  Cl-  conductor.  When  the  temperature  is not  too  low  the  mobility  differences may  be so  large (see Fig.  34  bottom),  that primarily depletion boundary effects are  to  be  expected  (as is also the  case  for  silver halides at  higher  temperatures). Such a  case  will be treated in  Chapter 2.6. An interesting variant  is encountered  in  the  case  of  anti-Frenkel defects, such  as  are  found in  alkaline earth  halides (cf. Chapter 2.3.12). Here,  because  of  the  validity of  the  corresponding  mass action

Fig.  33.  Possible interactions of the  mobile cation  with nucleophilic centres. The experiments described  in  the  text favour  the  right-hand mechanism. Figure  33b  also  indicates the  nucleophilic influence of  'water'. [6]

process, the  stabilization of  the  cation  is identical with  the  destabilization of  the  anion  (cf case  II  in Fig  6b). Since  u(F;)  &gt; 0~') it is the  upper profile in  Fig. 34  that  applies. However, as  described in  Chapter 2.3.12, F- stabilization is also  possible and even  probable  due to  the  amphoteric  nature of  the  surfaces.

We  can now  return  to  thallium(I) chloride, which forms an interesting test for  the  theory on account of its intrinsically dominant  anion conduction [8b]. No  effect is  observed at  moderate temperatures  (2 100°C)  if TlCl  is doped heterogeneously with  Al203 [8b], (Fig. 35,  curves  5  and 1).

This is  absolutely  consistent with the  expected  depletion  layer  (short-circuited by the  bulk). However  when measurements are  carried out  at lower  temperatures (lower  intrinsic concentrations, greater Debye  lengths), then  a  dominant Tl+ conduction  is evidently set up (curve  5)  as  the  result of the  formation of an adequate number  of Tl+ vacancies, as  is  shown  by the  low temperature activation energy  in  Fig. 5  [8b]. The fact that there  is no depression of  the  conductivity with  respect to  the  Arrhenius  branches  ('knee';  Koch-Wagner-effect)  in  the  higher  temperature  region, which must be the  case  for  suitable homogeneous doping (and which can be simulated  by doping with PbClz: Fig.  35,  curve  2), demonstrates  that  an impurity  effect is  not decisive. On  account of  the more favourable parameters  this is somewhat  more significant than  for  AgCl  (cf. CdClz doping in Fig.  22).

As is  illustrated in  Fig.  36 it is also  possible to  describe the  conductivity of  TlCl  quantitatively over  the  whole temperature  range  for  various  grain  sizes and concentrations in  the  second  phase. A value  fitted for  cvo  (4  x 10m5  moYcm3)  is appreciable below the  saturation level, so  that  it must be assumed  that  there  is  in  comparison  to above -  evidently a markedly weaker (possibly frozen-in) interfacial effect. However, &amp;o  and,  hence,  the  space  charge  potential is  of  the  same order  of  magnitude.  It  is not  clear if this is accidental or  if this term can  play  the  role of  a  limiting factor. The conductivity profiles for  various temperatures  perpendicular to  the  interface calculated using  the  above cvs  values  are  plotted in  Fig.  37.  It can be seen  that  the  depletion zones become more relevant as  the  temperature  is  increased. The extent  of  the  boundary  layer  is reduced at  the same time.  We  can also  recognize  additional fundamental eiements  in  Fig.  35:  1)  Comparison  of curves  2,4 and 5  shows that the  heterogeneous  effect is much  greater than  any possible maximum homogeneous effect (with  PbC12).

The reason for  this is  likely to  be that  the  (homogeneously  distributed) Pb,,  defects associate strongly with  the  Tl  vacancies and largely immobilize  these, while  in  heterogeneous  doping  this does not  take  place  on account  of  the  separation in  space  [Sb]. Furthermore it can  be  seen  (curve  3), that -as  already  observed  in the  case  of  AgCl and AgBr -  the  nominally  pure  polycrystalline TlCl  also

exhibits a heterogeneous  effect (see chapter  4). The fact that  there  is no reduction  in  conductivity at  higher  temperatures  also  reveals that  this is  not a  homogeneous effect. This phenomenon will be discussed  in  more  detail in  Chapter 4.  Finally curves  4 and 6 reveal the superimposition  of homogeneous and heterogeneous  effects, that  are  required  by the  above consideration: Curve 6 describes the  conductivity  of  heterogeneous  (Al2O3)  and homogeneous (PbC12)  doped  material, curve  4 describes the  conductivity of  polycrystalline TlCl(PbCl2). As expected  the  homogeneous effect predominates at  higher  temperatures, the  heterogeneous  effect at  low ones [ 131.

## 2.3.9. Homogeneous  and heterogeneous doping:  d@erences  and  similarities.

Since  in  addition  to  the  classical (homogeneous)  doping the  heterogeneous  doping represents the  second basic  mechanism  to influence a given  material  with  respect to the  defect  chemistry, the  basic  similarities and differences between homogeneous  and heterogeneous  doping [13] will be summarized  here.

The creation of  additional metal  vacancies in  M+Xby heterogeneous  doping according  to  the reaction equation  given  in  Chapter  2.3.7 (R7)  is similar to  homogeneous  doping (Zn  &gt; 0)  by cations of  higher  valence  (N2+ in  the  place  of  M+)  (or  by anions  of  lower  valence  ):

The  increase in  the  number  of  metal vacancies  then usually takes  place  homogeneously  (within

the sample) and linearly with the doping content  on account of the local  electrical neutrality applying  to  the  bulk. If it is assumed that interstitial metal  ions are  more mobile, then  homogeneous doping will first reduce  the  conductivity as  a  result of  a  depletion of  the  M;  defects; as  the  doping concentration  (D) increases it passes  through  a  minimum (a(M;) = a(V,')) at

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

finally the  vacancy conduction  predominates  at higher  levels (cf. Fig. 38a). The analogous  behaviour is  to be expected (at  constant  D)  in  the a-T  curve (Fig.  39)  on transition from high to low temperatures.

Quite  analogously  in  the  case  of  heterogeneous  doping there  is also  a  change at  a  critical coordinate  from M; conduction to  Vt  conduction  in  the  case  of  heterogeneous  doping (Fig. 38b)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

If  attention is  focussed  on the  (integral) a,  value, it  is  possible to  calculate the  critical concentration of  second phase at  which the  global change in  mechanism  occurs  from Eq. (36). It  can be seen  from Fig.  39 that  intrinsic onductivity dominates at  higher  temperatures  for  both doping mechanisms. (The factor  BDJ(l - VA)  remains  in  the  case  of  heterogeneous  doping (see  above).) The difference in  the  intermediate temperature  range  is significant. In  the  case  of  the  homogenous effect a  depletion of  M;  defects is clearly evident in  the  form of  a  'knee'  (i.e. Koch-Wagner-effect), while  in  the  heterogeneous  case  when  the  boundary  layers are  not too extended the  depletion layers are  at  least partly  short-circuited by the  bulk.  The difference in  association behaviour  has already  been discussed in  the  previous  chapter. An  extension  to  heterogeneously  doped extrinsic (i.e. heterogeneously  and homogeneously  doped) materials is straightforward.

## 2.3.10. Electronic  conductivity  in heterogeneous  electrolytes.

Following  the  remarks  in  Chapter  2.3.1 we will now return once  again to  the  problem of  electronic conduction in  this system  [I 11. If  it is assumed (arbitrarily) that the  cation  is stabilized then, in  the

case  of  a  pure  space  charge  effect with  respect to  the  electrons, it must be  expected  that n-conduction increases and p-conduction decreases because S(Vr,.r') = 9(e')  = -9(h.) &gt; 0 (see  Chapter 2.1). Wagner-Hebb polarizations of  LiI:AlzOs  [34,37] and AgI:A1203 [46] indicate an increase in  the  pconduction with  respect to  the  pure  material. The effect is very  weak in  CuCkAl2O3 [32] but  the tendency is analogous.  We  have  carried out  long-term  measurements on a  polarization cell

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

that  indicated that  the  p-conduction  is also  increased here. We  observed  appreciable effects on the minority  charge  carrier at  3Oo'C,  a  temperature  at  which a  two-phase  effect on the  majority  charge carrier can  no longer  be  detected. Reasonable  stationary characteristics are  impossible to  obtain  at

that  temperature  (see Fig.  40). Evidently  we were  observing  a  continuous  flux of  impurities, being important for  the  minority  conduction,  but  being  completely  negligible with  respect to  the  ionic majority  charge  carriers.

This  is not unexpected;  after all, in  the  case  of  AgCl  the  concentration of  the  minority  charge carrier lies more than  7  orders  of  magnitude lower  than  that of  the  ionic defects. The fact that  the effects are  greater for  samples  containing higher  concentrations, makes it likely that  the  diffusion source  is to  be  found in  the  Al203 particles.

However, it is possible to  record  stationary E-i-characteristics at  lower  temperatures  (see 2  1 YC, Fig.  41), at  which it is  necessary  to  take  account of  space  charge  effects (see  Fig.  22). The  long waiting  periods  are  due to  the  low value  of  the  chemical  diffusion coefficient. Figure  41  is characteristic for  the  current  increase in  the  p-region. An increase in  p-bulk-conduction  over  that of  pure

AgCl[97] (and  thus  a  decrease  of  n-bulk-conduction) as  a  result of  impurities may  be  understood in  terms  of  an incorporation of  O-defects  (on  a  very  minor level!) according  to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The existence of  Ok, impurities is  supported  by our observations of  homogeneous doping effects by AgzO  (cf. AgzS effect [98,99]).

A closer consideration (particularly of  the  n-component) requires that  we refine our discussion and take  space  charge  effects into  account.

For a  positive space  charge  potential (Ag+ adsorption) Eq. (30) and Eq.  (34)  yield

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

for  the  specific electronic conductivity  of a nonpolarized  two-phase sample.  It  can be seen  that space  charge  contribution depends greatly on bulk  values.

The next  step is to  extend  the  Wagner-Hebb  analysis, that was  derived for  homogeneous  materials, to  the  case  of  an inhomogeneous  initial distribution (Fig. 42).  The situation of  a  single interface in  a thought experiment is  shown  in  Fig.  42.  Since  it is  possible to  assume contact  equilibrium (@/ax)&amp;+ =  (g/ax)  Fe'  =  (a/ax) PAg = 0) the problem can be treated  (approximately)  as a parallel problem (y  = direction of  measurement).  It can  be  shown that the  regional current densities can be superposed analogously  to Eq. (34)  to yield  an effective current  density  i,,, and that  an excess  current  density  can also  be separated. The latter contribution is  obtained  from the  specific electronic excess  conductivity Aaeon in  the  following way [l 11:

(LX,  L,  = dimensions of and distance  of electrodes in  x and y direction). The  integration in the  stationary state over the  chemical  potential (the  dashes  indicate electrode contact)  usual  in the  Wagner-Hebb analysis is  followed  by another integration over the  x coordinate. The  above approximations  now  yield the  usual  evaluation formula for  a  two-phase  sample

(q: polarization potential), although  with  the  mean  specific  onductivity given  in  Eq.  (48). Since, to  a  good approximation,  C,O  and c yoo in  Eq.  (48) are  independent  of  the  silver activity, the  known relationship

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

is also  obtained  formally  -  but  again  with  the  effective non-constant  a-values  (that refer here to  silver activity 1), which are  defined according  to  Eq.  48 [l  11.

When account is  taken of the relatively large  voltage  realized in  the experiment,  Eq. (50b) simplifies to

It  is possible to  determine  a,&amp;  and a&amp;,  from the  plot  reproduced in  Fig. 43.  Comparison  with the  literature values  for  pure  AgCl  (O' KP) (T,,, give  what is at  first sight the  remarkable  result that both effective values  are  increased by about a power of  ten.  While increasing the  p-conductivity urn,,, =  (1  - PA)Uco,  = uca,  should reflect the  homogeneous effect *  , a,,, ought to be greatly affected by the  space  charge  potential (cf. Fig.  9):

If  the  value  obtained  in  the  independent  analysis of  the  majority  charge  carriers (Chapter  2.3.6) is  substituted for  cvo  and the  literature value  for  pure  AgCl  for  cvm  (at  215°C extrinsic effects do not play  any role  for  the  majority  charge  carrier), then it  follows  that  a,,,  = 35  x a&amp;,,,. Hence the  measured effective value  is  greater than the  bulk  value  by a factor  of  about 35 and thus  the bulk  value  is  smaller than  the  conductivity of  pure  silver chloride ( a&amp;, = (l/4)&amp;) as  would be expected  for an  impurity  effect that increases the  p-concentration. Thus,  the  result of  a  simultaneous increase in  n-  and p-conduction  can be explained  without  problem by means of  the  space  charge effect as  a result of  Ag+  adsorption. It  is not necessary  to  assume structural changes (although these  certainly take  place  to  some degree). It  is interesting to  note  that Valverde-Diez  and Wagner jr. [loll recently found the  same qualitative effect in  the  system  AgI$-AlzOs,  but  did  not  interpret

it further. There the  n-conduction is appreciably higher  than  for  AgCl, as  the  Al203 effect on the ions  is aiso  greater (cf. Eq. 17).

In  view  of  the  inaccuracies and approximations  in  the  model,  measurements and literature values (for  example the  neglect of  valence  changes [loo]) a better agreement (l/l0  instead of 114) is  not to  be expected  in  the  above analysis. The calculated conductivity profiles for  all relevant carriers (a,~  = 1, 215%)  are  illustrated in  Fig.  44.

Since  the above example involved  ionic  and electronic carriers, the general  case  of a mixed conductor can be tackled  (see  next  paragraph).  Important conclusions  can also  be drawn with respect  to semiconductors,  where often  the  ionic  point  defects are  in  majority. At least during preparation, if not during  the  measurements those  defects may  be mobile enough to  create  ionic space  charges. In  those  cases  the  electric fields at  the  boundaries  may  even be determined by the neighbouring phase with the  ions  (acid-base interaction) rather  than with the  electrons (redox interactions). This  is completely  neglected in  semiconductor  physics. A phenomenon like this may explain  why  (slightly) F-doped  SnOz  is advantageous as  an 02-sensor  material over  an acceptor doped  SnOr. In  the  second case  the  space  charge  effect may  be primarily acid-base controlled in contrast to  a  redox-control that  is desired  [73,102]. It  is also  clear that  generally 'heterogeneous doping'is  able  to  tune  the  degree  of  the  mixed conduction.

## 2.3.11. Complete  defect  chemistry of  AgCl  contacted with y-AIzO3.

The  above discussed  calculations and experiments  provided  the  first complete picture  of the defect chemistry  of  a  (mixed)  ionic conductor  not  only  in  the bulk  but  also at  a  given  interface (here interface AgCYy - A&amp;03). From  the  theoretical foundations given  in chapter  2.3.1 the  temperature and the  activity dependence of  the  majority  and the  minority  carriers can be obtained.

has  been assumed as  far as  the  ionic carrier is assumed.  This  is reasonable since effects of  Ag or  Cl2 on the  AgCl/A1203  interface are  only  expected  to  a  very  minor extent. Then, however,  according to  the  equilibria to  be  considered the  minority  carriers depend on UAs  or  Pclz (For  details see  [3e]).

2.3.12. The conductivity of  composites  involving other  ionic conductors (LiI  LiCl -CuCl  AgI NaCl  -  CaF2 -  BaF2 -  PbF2  -SKI2 etc.)

Our present  knowledge of  defect  parameters  unfortunately makes it impossible to  make  quantitative space  charge estimates for  calculation of  all systems  investigated so far  in  the  literature. Thus,  in the case  of the  compounds listed above,  the  relative mobility  data  are  unknown or  unsatisfactory sometimes even contradictory. In  the  case  of  CuCI, for  instance, not even the  enthalpy of  migration  of  Cu+  vacancies is  known  * . Jow and Wagner  found considerable effects in  CuCl on admixture of y-Al203 [32]. We, in  our laboratory, have used BaTi as  the  second phase [4].

*  If the  above  model is assumed to  apply  for  CuCl : Al203 also, a  value of  about  0.4 eV (=  EL,  see  Eq.  (42)) is probable.

When  the  difference in  the  geometric  parameters  according  to  Eq. (36)  is taken  into  acount the effect is  comparable and independent of  whether the  (relatively insulating) BaTi used is  n-  or p-conducting.  We  also  studied  single interface effects by applying  edge electrodes at  the  interface CuCYor-Al203  [4]. In  the  case  of  LiI  and AgI the  data  on defect parameters  is contradictory. For AgI (and  under certain conditions also  for  LiI[ 151) it is not  even  certain exactly what modification is  present  in  the  two-phase  mixture  (AgI :  fi or y or  (/!I and y)). However, the  above mechanism is  supported  in  both cases by the  activation energy  of  the  dispersions as  well  as  by the  analogous behaviour  of  polycrystalline and thin  film  material. More  recent measurements [25] reveal that  the appreciable differences in  the  activation energies that  are  observed  for  heterogeneously  doped and polycrystalline (extrinsic) AgI disappear  if one waits  long  enough, whereby a  (B/r)  phase  change occurs. There are  also  recent reports of  the  appearance  of  an  amorphous  AgI-phase  in  the  composites [103] (This  will be  discussed in  Chapter  2.5.2). The detailed impedance spectroscopic evaluation by Soltis et  al. [80] on AgI composites  do also not  give a  clearer picture about  the  penetration depth of  the  interfacial effects; similarly, results by Schmidt et  al. [104] only  indicate a  strong  interaction but  do not allow  a  distinction between a  pure  interfacial interaction or  a  chemical  reaction.

In the case  of LiI and on the basis  of the  mobility  data of Jackson and Young  [75]  Eq. (38)  yields values  that  are  about half  an order  of  magnitude lower  than those  determined experimentally. The  mobility  values  of Haven  [105] are  even lower,  while  mobilities from thinfilm  experiments  are  very  much  higher  [lOa]. However, the  latter data  are  probably debased by complicated  effects [15]. Here,  it is to  be  recalled (see Chapter 2.3.6) that the  estimate based  on Eq. (38) is not  reflecting the  maximum effect possible due to  the  discreteness of  the  problem.  Thus,  it is not  allowed  to  rule out  space  charge  effects in  this way.  In  addition the  LiI  used  apparently  always contains  water (see  Chapter 2.5.3). Even  extremely  carefully treated  material  evolves  methane on contact  with CH3Li (see  also  chapter  2.5.4). Moreover, the  very high critical second phase concentrations  (at  the  transition to blocking  regime)  should involve  extensive nano-size  effects (very  small  effective particle distances) which again  enhance the  overall conductivities (see Chapter 6).  With  the  latter assumption the  experimental  values  can be verified by the  calculations. It  it also  worth mentioning that  a  hexagonal modification of  LiI  can be observed  if present  as  a  thin film  on SiOz  under suitable conditions  (s. Chapter 2.5.2, Chapter 6). The interpretation of  contact resistances in  LilSOClz  battery systems  [106] by depletion of  Li+-vacancies in  the  LiCl  layer formed is also  worth mentioning in  this context.

Recently  some  work  has been published  on heterogeneously  doped  alkali earth  metal halides exhibiting anti-Frenkel disorder  [51-531. The above mechanism  would lead  to  the  expectation  of an increase  in  the  interstitial conduction (e.g. Fi)  in  CaF2  due to  internal adsorption  of Ca*+. Khandkar  et  al. [51] interpreted their experimental  results in  this manner.  Vaidehi  et  al. [52] argued for  an increase in  the  anion  vacancies as  a  result of  adsorption  of  the  halide ions. Although these investigations did  not succeed  in  making  an adequate  separation of  possible space  charge  effects from superimposed effects, which it was perhaps  not  possible to  achieve in  any  case  on account  of the  high  preparation temperatures  necessary, it seems  nevertheless not  implausible to  assume anion adsorption.  The  ambivalent  behaviour of oxide  surfaces is  well  known  and the  mobility  of the cations when preparing  these compounds  may be  too  low  (no  molten  state), to  be  able to  participate in  competitive  adsorption. Careful  investigations are  required here. This  is especially valid in  cases where no unambiguous  structural data  are  available. Moreover,  a  detailed impedance spectroscopic analysis and especially the  extraction of  the  relevant activation energies demands  deconvolution of parallel and perpendicular  effects as  described  in  Chapter 2.3.2. Such measurements  in  our laboratory  support  the  assumption of  F--adsorption  in  PbFz-composites [57].

We  have other  work  in  progress  [56] that  suggests an increase of  Vh  conduction in  CaF2  and PbF2 if the  grains have  been  pretreated in  SbFs.  This  would be  completely  in  line with  our  chemical model. In  the  case  of  the  super-Lewis  acids such  as  SbFs or  BF3 we definitley expect  a  stabilization of  F- at the  surface in  form of  SbF;  surface anions  and an  increase of  the  F--vacancy concentration (see  Chapter 4,  5). With SbFs there  is, however,  the  complication  of  a  compound formation  in  a certain temperature  range.  In all these  cases  also  the  oxygen and the  water  solubility has to be considered  [65].

Meanwhile  a huge amount  of  conductivity anomalies  in  heterogeneous  systems  have been re-

ported (involving Nasicon,  NaCI, LiF,  glasses, polymers etc.[53]) and partly  been interpreted by space  charge  effects. In  most cases  the  data  set was not complete enough  to  allow  for  a reliable quantitative analysis.

Generally speaking the interfacial situation can be very complicated especially under extreme chemical conditions. Thus  the proton conductivity  reported  in  [107]  in  systems such as Li2S04:A1203 or  RbNOJ:A1203 [108] under fuel cell conditions (Hz!)  may  be  due  to  the  formation of  hydroxide (+H# or  NH3)  [108]. Besides  the  purely  electrical effects, designed  composites  also offer the  possibility of  multifunctionality. In  particular organic/inorganic composites  may  lead  to a  combination of  favorable electrical and mechanical  properties [ 1091. But also  electrical effects of dispersions in  ionically conducting  polymers are  expected  due to  the  above reasons.

## 2.4. The  Catalytic  Activity  of  AgCllAI203 Composites

Beyond conductivity effects, the  increased defect concentration is expected  to  influence sensitively the  rate  of  chemical  or  electrochemical reactions. In  Ref.  [54] Simkovich and C.  Wagner  reported on an increase of  the  rate of  elimination of  HCl  from tertiary-butyl chloride

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

when  CdCl2 doped AgCl is present  in  the  reaction chamber  as  a  heterogeneous  catalyst. The rate constant  is roughly proportional  to [Cd2+] and thus  to  the  vacancy concentration. Besides, the possibility of  an acidic effect of  the  Cd&amp; centers, a basic  effect of  V&amp; is  probable, the  latter by relieving the  detachment of  the  protons; the  first by relieving the  detachment of  Cl-.  In  Ref.  [18] we reported  on similar experiments  using  AgClly-A1203 composites. The relative pressure increase during  reaction (55)  can  be  nicely used  to  follow  the  reaction kinetics.

As Fig.  46 shows the  effect is tremendous.  In  the  presence  of  AgClly-Al203  the  reaction at  T = 423 K  has  reached  equilibrium already  after 20  min,  whereas  not  even  a  significant reaction  start is observed  after such  a  waiting period  if pure  AgCl is used.

The effect of  pure  y-Al203 is not  insignificant but  much  lower  if related to  the  specific area  and can be partly  masked  by subsequent  reaction of  all pellets with  (CH3)jSiCl  (for  details see  [18]). The effective rate  constant  key  can be determined  from the  time  evolution of  the  overall pressure. Figure  47 clearly shows the  proportionality of  key  to  the  numbers  of  pellets reflecting the  active area. The constancy of  key  (K # number  of  surface sites) suggests that  adsorption  is rate limiting.

Fig.  47.  A  suitable plot  according  to  Ref.  [18] yields k,a  from the  slope. The behavior  is  shown for  different number  of  (identical) pellets (N) [18].

The density  of such active surfaces can be calculated by the  space  charge  considerations. According  to  [18] one obtains  for k,tr

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Figure 48 shows the temperature dependence  of kes.  The  Arrhenius behaviour allows  one to calculate the  effective activation enthalpy.

The parallel shifts are  not caused by different activation entropies, but rather  by the  different geometric  parameters.  If  we take  acount of  those  according  to  Eq.  (67) we end up with  a  unique value  for  AS* [ 181. If  we evaluate mass action  constants, a  unique  line is obtained  independent  of the  geometric  parameters  as  it should  be,  for  a  catalytic effect. More  details can be found in  [18].

Since  interfacial reactions lead  very  sensitively to  changes  in  defect densities, the  use  of  composite materials for  such  processes seems to  be  very  promising.

Recent investigation of the  effect of  heterogeneous  doping on electrode reactions, namely  on response  time  of  a  chlorine sensor  cell (AgCl-formation  cell)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

have  been studied. Significant effects were  found to  be  due  to  humidity  possibly but  not  necessarily pointing  in  the  discussed direction [17].

## 2.5. Approximations  and Limitations of  the  Ideal  Space Charge  Model

## 2.5.1. Inherent approximations

In  spite of  the  success in  describing the  conductivity effects in  the  composites  it is necessary to  bear in  mind the  approximations  involved, not  to  speak  of  the  uncertainty involved  in  the  experimental data  and the  parameters  brought  in. The above  treatment assumes  that mobility, dielectric constant, molar volume  and standard  potential are  independent  of  locality. This  can be accepted  to  a  first approximation so  long  as  no appreciable structural influence is to  be  expected  from electric fields, elastic or  plastic effects (cf. also  the  assumption of  transport parallel to  the  phase  boundary).  The same approximation is  used successfully in  the  field of  semiconductor physics, nevertheless from

Fig.  48.  Arrhenius  plots  of the  effective rate  constant  and of the  equilibrium constant  of the elimination under various  conditions (qx  volume fraction: N: number of  pellets and r:  0.06~).

semiconductor physics one  is familiar with  local changes  of  the  band gap  at  interfaces. A refinement to  those  cases  (which  is probably  more  important  here  than  for  semiconductor physics  since  the ionic  constituents are  affected) could be very complex  and requires more  precise experimental information.  In  the  case  of  a simultaneous  change in  c(x)  and u(x)  for  one and the  same charge carrier it follows  from

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

(ii,  2 are  the  arithmetic means of  the  values before  and after the  change)  that, for  a  given Au, the space  concentration  effect is the  more important  the  lower  the  bulk  concentration and the  higher the  mobility.

If  novel  migration  processes at  the  phase  boundary itself (which  in  principle are  contained  in  the third term of  Eq.  (36)) are  dominant in  a, there ought,  however,  to  be  marked deviations from the bulk  values of  the  migration  enthalpies. It appears  very  unlikely, but  cannot  be  completely  excluded, that  the  prefactor  alone would  change.  In the  discussed cation  conducting composites partial blocking  of  fast pathways by  vacancy conducting  regions would also be  in  line with  the  temperature dependence. In  view of  the  effective activation enthalpy  (migration enthalpy  of  vacancies  even at high  temperatures) however,  these  regions should  be space  charge  regions again.  Reproducibility, values  of the  capacitance  and especially the  experiments  in  the  previous  chapter  speak against this  complicated situtation. A refinement  would  be to seek  a possible change in  the standard thermodynamic  values  on the  basis of  structural relaxations or  elastic effects. But it is not  possible to  take  account of  such  effects at  the  present time  because  the  accuracy  of  measurement  does  not allow  detailed conclusions on these  lines. Very recent measurements of  the  overall thermodynamics of  the  composite electrolytes have  been performed with  the  electrochemical cell

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The results proved,  that  deviations of  the  formation  enthalpy  and entropy  of  the  composite from the  values  for  pure  AgCl  are  very  minor and can be attributed to  the  surface interactions and/or thermoelastic strain due to  different expansion  coefficients [S 11.

The  most  important aspects  of the  problem  of the  underlying  simple  distribution topology (cf. also  one-dimensional  treatment) and the  assumption of  constant  b-factors have already  been discussed. This also  applies to the  assumption of a Boltzmann  distribution for  effects close  to saturation (see also  Chapter 2.5.2).

It  has  also to  be  borne in  mind that the  discreteness of  the  atomistic problems is not  adequately appreciated in  the  continuous  approach as  described in  Chapter 2.3.6.

The  assumption of semi-infinite boundary  conditions  having  one finite limit is  a fundamental point.  The  Debye  length  is rather  large  particularly at  low temperatures  so  that  these  conditions can sometimes be broken.  As shown  in  Chapter 6  this may  be associated with  a further increase in  conductivity (cf. 'nano-size  factor'). As shown on page 29,  the  assumption of  a  pure  material is not  critical for  the  evaluation.

## 2.5.2. Space  charge induced boundary  phases

The effect of  high  concentrations occuring  in  space  charge  effects close to  the  interface deserves a  special consideration. Naively, one may assume that an  increase of  defect concentrations over  the Boltzmann  dilution limit would result always  in  a  harmless  correction to  the  calculated behavior. There may, however, exist conditions, where the situation changes qualitatively. In spite of the positive standard  free enthalpy  of  defect formation,  there  is an equilibrium concentration of  point defects in  any ionic  crystal due to  the  initially steep  increase of  configurational entropy  with  the number  of  defects, resulting in  a  minimum in  the  total free  enthalpy  (plotted as  a  funtion  of  the defect  number)  at  very  small  defect  numbers. Most  defect-defect interactions and also  structural changes that  can also  be expressed  in  terms of defect-defect interaction lead  to an additional contribution in  G  falling with  the  defect numbers.  In  many  cases  this results in  a  second  minimum at  comparably high  defect numbers.  Under certain conditions, especially at  high  temperatures, this minimum may  become  the  absolute  minimum.  Then  a transition occurs  from a low-disordered state to a highly  disordered  state [llO,lll]. Such transitions may  be superionic transitions such as  the  transition from  the /3-AgI  phase to the oc-AgI  phase,  or the  higher  order transition in PbF2 where the  cation-sublattices are  considered  to  be  molten.  In  materials where the  completely molten state is lower  in  free  energy, an overall melting  takes  place. The qualitative reasons  for  the transition is simple: At low defect concentration the  formation  of  a  new defect does  not  depend on the  number  of  already  existing defects. This  changes  at  high  concentration values. If  the  presence of already  present  defects  facilitates the  formation of new  ones,  a positive 'feed-back'  results and a disordered  lattice becomes  very favorable in  free energy.  Recently  this behaviour  could be quantitatively interpreted for  different ionic conductors  by a  cube root  law [1 111 just reflecting the mean  defect-defect distance.

Such an instability is  due to defect-defect interactions. Since  high defect  concentrations  are expected under some  cirumstances  in  space  charge  regions, a local  phase transformation  at  the boundary  may  occur [1 111 (see  also  Ref.  [112]) (even  though the  nature  of  the  defect-defect interactions is  different from those  in  the  bulk). In  the  superionic phase  the  Debye  length  is  small, space  charge  effects have probably  vanished, also  the  defect  profile in  the  adjoining bulk  phase  is not  as  steep as  before  due  to  the  screening effect of  the  superionic phase  with  respect to  the  surface interaction. Such effects probably  account  for  another  class of  boundary  conductors,  whose small activation enthalpies point  to  a  liquid-like surface conduction,  but  may  also explain the  occurrence of  amorphous  phases  in  AgI : Al203.

In  particular since charge  and counter  charge  are  separated in  space  charge  regions such  effects do not unavoidably happen. In  AgCl  and AgBr  especially (also CuCI, TlCl,  LiI)  the  activation enthalpies as  well  as  X-ray-studies [6&amp;l]  point  to  a  'normal' space  charge  behavior.

## 2.5.3. Discussion of  alternative models

Every competitive  model has  to  explain the  fact that  for  the  compounds given  in  Figs. 5,  20  the activation energy of  the  conductivity corresponds  to  the  bulk  value  of  the  enthalpy  of  migration of  the  metal  vacancies.

First let us  search  for  hypothetical alternatives that  could  also  fulfil this requirement. The most obvious  alternative is an  impurity  effect as  a  result of  higher valency  cations. The classical argument

of  Liang to  exclude  such  a  possibility lies in  reference to  the  observed  dependence on the  volume fraction in  the  second phase.  A  few percent  by volume  would certainly be sufficient to  maintain a saturation of  homogeneous impurity. This  argument,  however,  is not sufficient, here  are  several possibilities to explain  such  behaviour  [3e]:

- (a)  Small  quantities of  A13+  could  be  liberated during  preparation and then  remain  (more or  less) homogeneously  frozen  in  the  material at  the  temperature  of  measurement.
- (b)  The number  of  high  valency  cations available could  be  determined  by  the  surface of  the  second phase,  Thus it could  be  imagined  that  foreign cations on the  surface of  the  Al203 (or  possibly segregated out)  could  be  responsible for  the  effect or  A13+  cations which could  have  been  -to pick  out  one hypothesis -  introduced  into  the  material as  a  result of  taking  part  in  an acidbase  reaction with  the  OH groups  according  to  the  following hypothetical overall reaction:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Solubilities in  LiI  as  a  result of  effective foreign cations have  been demonstrated  to  be  very  low [4]. Impurity  effects such  as  those  described above have  been excluded  for  a  number  of  reasons  in  the case  of  TlCl,  in  particular:

- (a)  the  extent  of  this effect in  comparison to  the  effect of  PbC12,
- (b)  the  significant absence  of  the  Koch-Wagner-effect  ('knee')  in  the  log-l/T  curve.

For these  reasons  very  detailed experiments  have  been  carried out  in  AgCl and AgBr  to  refute such a  mechanism  [3fl, The results are  illustrated in  Fig. 44 and Fig.  50:

- (i) The conductivity effect is not dependent on the  duration  of  preparation  (Fig. 50).
- (ii) Even with  AlC13 it is not  possible to  produce such  a  homogeneous  effect in  AgCl  (Fig.  50).
- (iii) If  the  A1203 particles are  removed  from the  two-phase  mixture  (dissolution of  AgCl  in  NH3, separating and washing  the  aluminium oxide  phase  with  HCl, combining the  two solutions in excess  HCI, filtering off  and drying  the  precipitated AgCl, preparing  samples  and measuring it), the  conductivity effect disappears (Fig. 50). This  demonstrates  the  evident  importance of the  physical presence  of  Al203 particles. (It is not  possible to  exclude  certain inhomogeneous influence of  A13+  ions  in  the  space  charge  zone completely.)

If  the  case  of  an independent  conductivity mechanism  as  in  the  case  of  effects discussed in  the previous  chapter  the  only  remaining  possibility of  directly observing  the  enthalpy  of  migration  of metal vacancies  in  the  bulk [4] is  that  highly  conducting  paths, that  determine  the  conductivity (o,,, = o,;n,p&amp;, are  'interrupted' by only  moderately conducting  parts  of  specific conductivity  CJ (a,,, =  &amp;,athQ)patho,+, CC  (T, since  the  path is in  series to  them).  The  major part  of  the  pathway would have to  be extremely  conductive  in  such  a  case  so  that the  few blocking  regions  determine the  path  resistance, on the  one hand (i.e. weighted  for  the  bulk  fraction and the  &amp;factors), and,  on the  other  hand,  the  effective conductivity of  the  complete  pathway remains  still high  with  respect to  the  pure  substance.

Now  the  observed  energy  of  activation is approximately  the  enthalpy  of  migration  of  the  metal vacancies, but not that  of the  bulk (at  moderate temperatures  the  enthalpy  of formation is  appreciable for  the  bulk  material), so that  it has  to  be assumed in  such  a case  that, in  contrast  to the  remaining material, these  blocking  ionic  conductor regions  are  suitably doped  or that  there are  specific thin-layer effects, such as  were discussed in  Chapter 6,  operative in  these  regions. In the  last case  at  least -  if not under much  more  general  conditions, as  suggested  by calculations carried out by Blender  and Dieterich [77] -  the  assigned effective capacity  would be expected  to be much  higher  than that  found experimentally. Severe  non-reproducibility and new  percolation thresholds ought also  to  be observed,  neither of  which are  found experimentally. Neither  does it seem possible to  interpret consistently the  effects about  to  be  described in  two-ionic conductor mixtures, in  polycrystalline materials (e.g. NH3  effect) or  thin-layer effects by other  mechanism  than a space  charge  mechanism.  Note in  this context  especially the  effects induced by gaseous  species, the  effect on heterogeneous  catalysis or  the  behavior  of  the  minority  species. It  is not completely possible, however,  to  exclude  a  complicated  superimposition of  various  influences, particularly the

Fig.  49.  The conductivity effects in  AgBr:AhO, (after sintering!) are  not  a  function of  time  [3fl

fjord  effects in  fractal structures in  all cases.

At this point,  the  work of  two authors  deserves  special attention viz. the  work of  Phipps et  al. and the  work  of Dudney.  Phipps and Whitmore  [41,42] investigated the  boundary  between LiI and SiO2 and found a fast pathway with  a  novel  activation enthalpy. Even if we neglect the  fact that  the  use  of  point  electrodes may  modify the  effective activation enthalpy, this result does not contradict the  overall scheme.  At the  contact  to  a  SiOz-crystal no strong  surface interactions and thus  no strong  space  charge  effects are  expected. Thus proper  surface pathways with  independent migration-values should,  if existing, show up.  The  situation becomes clearer in  the  discussion of

LiI  thin  films in  Chapter 6.

Dudney  performed systematic experiments  on AgCl  composites  giving evidence  for  the  importance  of  stress effects and dislocations [60]. External  stresses give  rise to  an  increase in  the  conductivity [5]. Such effects are  well  known  to  play  a  role in  freshly prepared  materials either polycrystalline samples or thin  films  [60,13]. This will be treated in  detail in  Chapter 5  and 6.  A careful annealing  is able  to  heal  out  most of  these  effects. Even modifiying  the  boundary  conditions  the main question  in  this context  is not  the  existence of  stable dislocations after annealing: It is possible that  a  stable configuration of  Al203 layers in  an  AgCl matrix  may involve stable dislocations, in  the same way as  small  angle  grain  boundaries  may  be attributed to  a  disclocation arrangement.  The main question  is, if these  dislocations provide  a  novel  pathway with  novel  migration  parameters, or  if space  charge  effects play  a  major role. In  our  view an overwhelming amount  of  evidence  as already  given  above and as  will be given  below confirm  the  latter point. It  is also  known  in  particular  from dislocations in  AgCl  that the  charges  of  space  charge  zones  involved can have  the  same sign  as  discussed above [87]. In  the  silver halides even  the  non-stationary effects of  sample preparation, e.g. pressing, are  likely to  be  space  charge  effects as  laid down  in  Chapter 5.  A more direct indication of  space  charge  effects by impedance spectroscopy  of  a single AgCl-oxide interface is discussed in  Chapter 2.6.

## 2.54. Discussion of  other methods of  measurement

The analysis of  the  surface at  solid-solid interfaces is fundamentally  more  difficult than of  free surfaces  [113]. The  removal of discrete layers  is  always associated with in-situ changes in the boundary  conditions. Although experiments  at  ceramic  interfaces suggest  concentration  profiles and basically support the  mechanisms  proposed here  these  sources  of  error  cannot be ignored [114]. In  the  case  of  the  systems  described here  there  are  other  problems in  addition to  the  small width of  the  layer; these  include the  radiation sensitivity of  the  silver halides (STEM,  SAM,  XPS, LEED etc.), their  sensitivity to moisture  in  the  case  of LiI  and to  oxygen in  the  case  of CuCl. IR and microwave experiments  suggest an interfacial interaction [95,115]. We  have  initiated IBIQ experiments,  b-NMR and (pulsed  field gradient), NMR, high  resolution infrared measurements and ESR  investigations from which we hope to  obtain  further information. The interpretation of the  NMR spectra so  far obtained  is controversial [2 1,22,90,28,116]. Some  authors  are  in  agreement that  the  majority  of  Li  ions  in  LiI:AlzOs  and LiBr-  H20:AlzO are  in  an environment that  differs from that  of  the  bulk, which could  be  the  result of  the  formation  of  an  extended  interaction layer (possibly even a third  phase that  is  only stable in  the  boundary  layer) and/or  of the  formation of space charge zones in  the  thin-film region.  It  is  not possible to eliminate the possibility of additional effects, especially in  the  case  of  these  two very water-soluble substances, whose bulk defect  chemistry  itself is  in  dispute. This applies particularly when  inadequately dried  aluminium oxide  is used,  as  in  Ref.  [116].

X-ray experiments have been carried  out by almost every author who  has published  results on the systems  under consideration  here. The  results confirm that  no global  chemical reaction has  occurred  but  do not  provide  the  basis for  adequate  conclusions concerning  local interactions. Interestingly in  AgI : Al203 (in contrast to  AgCl : Al203 and AgBr: Al203 [81]) some amounts of amorphous  phases  have  been detected  [103].

As already  reported  recently the  standard  free enthalpy  has  been measured by e.m.f. techniques [8 11. Only small  deviations are  found which can,  if meaningful  at  all, be  contributed to  the  surfacesurface  interaction, and/or  to  thermoelastic strains.

Wagner jr.', group  has  carried out  calorimetric determinations on  AgI-Al203 two-phase  mixtures (and  on the  two ionic conductor system  AgI:AgBr) (see Chapter 2.3.3) [27,114]. The authors  found perceptible excess  enthalpies in  comparison to  'mechanical'  mixing and interpreted the  findings in  terms of  defect  formation in  the  above sense. The  values  obtained  are  rather  large, so elastic effects and acid-base interactions cannot be  left out  of  consideration. Qualitatively the  effect on the temperature  of  the  /?/cx transformation  by the  addition of  Al203 takes  place  in  the  same manner as  by homogeneous doping with  high  valency  cations and can be  correlated with  the  space  charge model [25,26].

Thermoelectric  measurements  on the  system  AgI:AlzOs have  also  been interpreted in  terms  of

Ag+  vacancies  by Shahi  and Wagner  [46].

Evidence for  space  charge  zones  at  the  surfaces of  silver halides has  been obtained  by L.  Slifkin's research  group [87,117,118]: These authors  doped AgCl  and AgCl  homogeneously  with MnCl2, whose rate of  diffusion is great enough to  reach  equilibrium within  a  week,  but  low  enough to  bring about  perceptible changes  in  the  Mn  profile during  the  experiment. Individual layers were  removed by precise etching  with  great  spatial resolution using  suitable aqueous solutions. The  Cl profile was monitored  simultaneously. This gentle  method  (in  contrast  to SIMS)  yielded  a profile that was in  agreement with  the  calculated space  charge  profile. As regards  the  quantitative evaluation s. Chapter 6.

## 2.6. Detection  of a  Single  Ionic  Space  Charge  Layer  by Impedance  Spectroscopy

Recently  we succeeded  in  investigating ionic space  charge  effects at  a  single interface oxide/AgX for  the  first time [19]. As has been discussed above,  space  charge  effects at  a single interface are difficult to  measure by conductance experiments. In  a  measurement  perpendicular to  the  interface an enhancement  layer  cannot be seen  even  in  a  parallel experiment,  the  conductance effect is too small  to  be  detected  (if not  very  thin  films are  used  as  in  chapter  6). On the  other  hand,  depletion effects resulting in  the  occurence of  a thin  insulating layer, would not be measured in  a parallel experiment but  might be seen  in  a series experiment.  In  order  to  investigate the  above discussed ionic  space  charge  effects in  such  a  way,  two conditions have  to  be  fulfilled:

- (1)  Second  phase materials have to be found which act  with respect  to the  cations  as  a base similarly as  y-Al203 (i.e. sufficiently), but  nevertheless exhibit a high  electronic conductivity to  be  used  as  electrodes (in contrast to  the  insulating alumina).
- (2)  Measurements  involving  the  silver halides  have to be performed at  elevated  temperatures, where the  interstitial conductivity  significantly prevails over the  vacancy contribution  such that  an accumulation of  cations at  the  interface corresponds  to  strong  depletion effects (see Fig.  31,  bottom).

(It  should also  be noted that  the  effects of insulating layers  are, if  at  all, not reliably seen in dispersed systems, since they  are  partly short-circuited by the  better conducting  bulk  * , whereas  the detection of  highly  conductive  layers requires the  high  interfacial density  of  composites.) Recently such measurements  succeeded for  the  first time.  RuOz,  Fe304,  Nb~05\_~,  Lao.sSrs.sCo03 turned out  to  be  applicable phases. They were,  in  polycrystalline or  monocrystalline forms,  contacted  with AgCl  or  AgBr  single crystals, the  other  side of  which was contacted  by sputtered Pt.  Details are found in  Ref. [ 191.

In  addition  to  the  bulk  impedance  three  further  impedance signals were detected  with  all the oxides, one can be  unambiguously  attributed to  the  insufficient contacts (point contacts [78,79]), a further one (at the  lowest  frequencies) to  a  Wagner-Hebb  polarization. The remaining  semi-circle indicates the  depletion layer  due to  the  following reasons:

- (1)  The  signal does not appear if  Ag  or Pt is used as  electrode material rather  than the  above oxides.
- (2) The signal depends on interfacial conditions but  not  on the  thickness of  the  solid electrolyte.
- (3)  The signal is bias  dependent.
- (4)  The temperature  dependence of  the  corresponding  resistance corresponds  to  the  temperature dependence  of the  bulk value. This is  in  agreement with  the  extra  resistance calculated in Eq.(28). Since  the  T-dependence of  Ji;;; is small, the  T-dependence of  the  space  charge  resistance  = AZ1  is given  by

and thus  roughly  by half of  the  Frenkel  enthalpy

*  Blocking  effects giving  rise to  a low frequency  impedance branch,  are  visible but  are  difficult to  evaluate due to  the complex microstructure.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Figure  51  shows data  for  AgBr  where a  measured value  of  0.75  eV fulfills exactly the  expectations.

- (5)  Even more indicative, since very  significant, is the  temperature  dependence of  the  corresponding  capacitance. Whereas  C-values  are  normally more  or less independent of  temperature, space  charge  capacitances are  expected  to  increase strongly with  temperature  due to  decreasing  Debye  length.

As  well  known from  electrochemistry, the space charge capacitance  is  inversely proportional to h. Since h  DC &amp;* and  since  the AgX-bulk  is  intrinsic (i.e. cm  CC  exp-AFHo/2) the temperature  dependence  is  predicted  to be AFH'/~.  Figure 51 confirms the  prediction  with EA  = 0.36eV (AFH'(AgBr) = 1.2 - 1.4eV).

The absolute  values  of  the  space  charge  response  are  not  very  meaningful  due to  the  insufficient contact. On  the  other  hand, this complication  is  certainly fortunate in  to  make  the  space  charge effect measurable [19,119]. At present  we are  investigating the  response  using  different designs, special point  electrodes as  well  as  a new method  to  scan  the  distance from the  interface by frequency variation [75,120]. In  this 'penetration impedance technique'  the  interfacial behavior  can be nicely  and sensitively detected. The AglAgCl  contact  studied  is  probably  characterized by an ionic  inversion layer  as  a  consequence of  Ag+  injection by the  Ag-metal.

So far  the  bias  dependence for  the  oxidelAg-contact could  not  be reasonably  evaluated  since  a superposition of  the  space  charge  polarization with  the  Wagner-Hebb  effect (stoichiometric bulk polarization) occurs.  Momentarily, theoretical calculations are being performed  to understand better the  complete impedance response  in  a  mixed conductor from a  fundamental point  of  view [75]. Nevertheless, these  measurements provide  clear evidence  for  the  expected  ionic space  charge effect. Also in  our laboratory  ionic  field effects at  the  boundary  of  AgCl  to  insulating oxides  are under study. However, it  may  well  be that  ionic  field effects in  these  systems  cannot be detected due to  a  comparably high  core  disorder [75].

## 3. INTERFACES BETWEEN  TWO IONIC CONDUCTOF&amp; (CONDUCT. ANOMALIES  IN MISCIBILITY  GAPS)

Enormous conductivity  effects have also  been detected  in two-phase  mixtures,  i.e.  misciblk. gaps  involving ionic  conductors:  first in  8-AgI : AgBr  [44,45] (see Figs.  3, 52c), but  later on also in  the  system  AgI : &amp;Cl [161 (see below)  and in  other  chemically more complex ones  (see  Fig.  3) [53]. In Frenkel  disordered  systems, we would expect  a double effect if  the  above  heterogeneous doping mechanism  is  taken  as  the  explanation. The  silver ion  can pass  not only  from one ionic conductor to the  interface, it  can also  pass  into  the  boundary  layer  of the  neighbouring  ionic conductor.  The  situation is  analogous to  the  contact  potential formed at  a contact  between two electronic conductors  (see also [121] and Fig.  52a). According  to  Fig. 6b  one  ionic conductor  (MX') represents, as  it were,  a  cationophile, while  conversely the  other  (MX)  has  a  destabilizing effect on the  cations. If  Frenkel  equilibria are  assumed this transformation can be described  adequately  by transfer of  a  defect  Vi,:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Equivalently  the  process  can be described  by the  transfer of M;  or by a homogeneous Frenkel equilibrium.

The latter formulation  is most suitable from the  point  of  view  of  the  majority  charge  carriers

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  this way  the  vacancy concentration  is  increased in  one ionic conductor (MX)  and that  of  the interstitial particles in  the  other  (MX') (Fig. 52). When  there is contact  between two Schottky  ionic conductors large effects (i.e. beyond the  level of  intrinsic concentrations) are  not  to  be  expected  in the  absence  of  the  possibility of  accumulating  charge  at  the  phase  boundary  (see Chapter 4)  or  of introducing  ions  interstitially at  least in  the  boundary  layer, so  that the  negative results obtained with  the  system  LiBr : LiI  are  by no means surprising [122].

The thermodynamic  calculation [7] closely follows that  in  Chapter 2.1. An even more complete phenomenological treatment  is possible, as  the  bulk  thermodynamics  in  both  materials is defined. The variation of  the  relevant functions is reproduced  in  Fig.  53.  Equation (11)  relates the  concentration of the  defects in  the  bulk  with  that  in  the  interface (cf. Fig.  52b), x = 0 and x'  = 0.  The heterogeneous  Frenkel  equilibrium, referred to  x = 0  and x'  = 0,  now  interrelates both concentration  parameters  cvo  (=  cv(x  = 0))  and cio (= ci(x' = 0))  by application of  the  equilibrium condition ,SVjfij = 0.  For sufficiently dilute defects

is obtained  (dashed  parameters  refer to  MX'). The condition  of  global  electrical neutrality, which is  equivalent to  the  continuity of  the  dielectric displacement  (absence  of  charge  accumulation  at the  interface) on account of the  Poisson  equation,  makes it  possible to  calculate the  remaining free concentration parameters  and the  potential jump  across the  interface. This  gives (c': standard potential) for  semi-infinite boundary conditions:

A 1 G; is  the  free standard  enthalpy  of  the  heterogeneous  Frenkel  reaction, that  can be related toayhe  standard  enthalpy  of  transfer of  V' As  and Ag,: and the  bulk  values. K takes  account of  the potential jump  at  the  interface and can be calculated by assuming a charge  carrier-free contact zone (characterizable by an effective dielectric constant) [7].

The contribution to  the  normalized parallel conductivity, AYII,  such  as comes into  the  bicrystalline experiment  illustrated in  Fig. 59,  is calculated as:

[7]

The electrochemical equilibrium 'constant'  1';F* characterizes the  product  of  the  pure  chemical constant  of  the  heterogeneous  Frenkel  reaction (standard chemical  work) and the  electrical potential factor  (electrical work).

An estimate using  realistic data  for the  free energy  of  transfer reveals that it is possible to  explain conductivity  effects of the order  of magnitude under discussion [7]. In addition, we have to  be aware of  the  possibility of  charge  storage in  the  core  (see next  chapter).

Since  both phases  possess similar conductivities the  superposition of  possible conductivity paths is much  more  difficult here  than  it was in  Chapter 2.  However, on account of  the  nature  of  both phases, the  present  case  probably  adequately  fulfils the  conditions of  similar grain  form and size and random  distribution of  both  phases  (see Chapter  2.3.3). Thus,  here, a  Monte  Carlo  calculation as  laid down  by Roman et  al. [63] would seem profitable.

In  fact when the  data  in  the  original publication (see Fig.  3) of  Shahi  and  Wagner  [59] are  plotted in  a suitably modified manner  as  in  Fig.  52c,  they  exhibit the  typical and calculated profile for random  distribution (cf. Fig.  17). However, on account  of  the  double  function  of  both phases, the 1.h.s. region  of  Fig.  17c  appears  -  crudely  put  -  as  a  mirror  image.

If  realistic grain  sizes of  the  order  of  10m2  . . .  IO-'pm  (or  even  less) are  assumed (cf. preparation by cooling  homogeneous  mixtures  in  the  region of  the  miscibility gap)  and Eq.  (34) is used  to  make

a  crude  estimate of  the  maximum effect, then  the  experimental  results are  explicable, in  particular if the  nano-effects are  also  taken  into  account(Chapter  6).

Recently  the  conduction mechanism  and the  effects of  microstructure on the  enhancement  have been thoroughly  studied for  the  system  AgCl-jl  AgI by using  impedance spectroscopy  [16].

The conductivity  effects as  a  function  of  the  volume content  are  given  in  Fig.  55 for  one temperature. The microstructure has  been studied by etching  experiments  and Auger maps [123].

In agreement with that  impedance  spectroscopy  shows two similar high  frequency semicircles exhibiting conductivities higher  than  the  bulk  (completely in  agreement  with  the  equivalent circuit). The  bulk is  not observed,  since  short-circuited (Also not observed are  perpendicular  blocking effects.). The  ratio  of  resistance and capacitances allow  us  to  derive  the  fractions of  homo-  and heterojunctions (ri and 12).

Although considerable agglomeration  occurs, the  microstructure can  be  simplified as  follows: One recognizes  that  interfacial pathways consist of  homo-  and heterojunctions. Conduction  via  pure percolating pathways consisting of  heterojunctions only is improbable due to  the  only  moderate conductivity ratios (- 10 :  1) in  view  of  their low probability (Fig. 56).

To a crude  approximation this means that

where 1  and 2  indicate the  two heteroand homoeffects. Fig.  57  shows that both ratios are  roughly comparable and diverge  in  the  center  of  the  phase diagram;  at  nearly  equal  volume  fractions (of course  depending on given  size and distribution) the  f2  0, Ii -1  and h/Ii  co.

At high  temperature  where AgI is always  in  the  a-form no second  phase  effect is obvious.  Here the  conduction occurs  via  highly  conducting Ix-AgI  grains  resulting in  a  typical percolation law (Fig. 58).

Figure 59 gives  the activation enthalpies as a function  of volume  fraction of AgI  for  three temperatures. In  curve  a,  EA is  close to  0.3  eV the  migration  enthalpy  of  the  vacancies. This  does not  reveal much  on the  mechanism  since also  the  solid solutions, i.e. the  pure  phases, exhibit these values.

However, this value  is also  maintained  in the  gap  at higher  temperatures (curve  b), where the  pure phases  exhibit higher  values  (intrinsic). This  points  to  a  vacancy mechanism  in  both homo-  and heterojunctions. At temperatures  where AgI exists only  in  the  a-AgI phase  the  activation enthalpy is much  lower  in  agreement with  the  above consideration.

Fig.  60  finally shows how  a  vacancy conduction  can be  realized in  both homo-  and heterojunctions. This  is in  line with  a  transfer of  Ag+  from /3-AgI to  AgCl. [124,16]

This  two-phase effect also  opens up a range  of  possibilities a well  as  posing  many  interesting questions, with  respect to  both the  direction of  future research projects (e.g. multilayers) both from an experimental  (multilayers) and from a  theoretical point  of  view  (molecular  dynamic simulation of  contact  and phase equilibrium). Meanwhile  many  other, especially fluoride, systems  have  been investigated [53]. Of special interest are  conductivity variations due to  morphological changes in these  systems.  On  account of chemical  complexity and thermodynamic uncertainty, however, a quantative  analysis has  not  been possible.

## 4. GRAIN BOUNDARIES (CONDUCTIVITY ANOMALIES IN POLYCRYSTALLINE MATERIALS)

Grain boundaries (and the  same is  true  for  single dislocations) constitute another important heterogeneity  in  solid  systems.  As  already  mentioned  several times (AgCl, AgBr, TlCl) similar phenomena occur in  pure polycrystalline materials to those  in  ionic  conductor/oxide  mixtures. Boundary  layer phenomena were also  postulated by Khandkar  and Wagner to  explain the  particle size dependence of  the  conductivity of  polycrystalline AgCl samples  [33]. Although this dependence

and the  temperature  dependence found can  both  still be  explained in  terms  of  dissolved impurities, the  absence  of  a  conductivity 'knee' (Koch-Wagner  effect) at  high  temperatures  (cf. Figs. 22,  35) in  the  silver halides and particularly in  the  case  of  TlCl  points to  space  charge  effects. On account of  the  symmetry  of  the  properties (e.g. chemical  potential of  the  charge  carrier, see  Fig. 61)  on both sides  of  the  grain  boundary  and the  observed activation enthalpy, it  has  to  be assumed  that  an accumulation  of  Ag+  or  Tl+  at the  grain barrier is favoured  on  crystal-chemical grounds or  because of  the  chemical  effect of  the  segregated impurities at  the  grain boundary.  The result is symmetrical space  charge  zones  enriched  with  metal  vacancies on both sides of  the  grain boundary (cf. Fig.  61).

Even though elevated grain  boundary  conductivity is normally attributed to  core  effects ('pipe

diffusion')  [20], the  phenomenon of  space  charges  is not  unknown in  the  context  of  grain  boundaries, where a measurable mobility  of  ionic  defects is  expected  to  be of  importance [114]. In  the present  case  according  to  the  previous  discussion it is  once again  the  activation energy  that  provides  evidence  of  dominance  of  the  second mechanism  (according to  Fig. 6b).  As a  driving force for  the  charge accumulation (ionic segregation) we consider, in  addition  to  the  simple  osmotic pressure  effect, a structural, i.e. chemical,  stabilization of  the  ions  in  the  proper  interfacial layer. On the  basis of  very  similar results in  other  ionic conductor systems  it is possible to  explain in  this manner  a  whole range  of  phenomena,  that  were previously not  understood [9,12].

The  contributions to the  conductivity  parallel and (approximately) perpendicular  to a grain boundary  are  described  by Eq. (22)  and Eq. (26). There are  no difficulties in  including  separate core  effects in  the  manner  illustrated in  Fig.  62.  While it is immediately  obvious  that, in  the  case of parallel effects, the impedance  can be described  by parallel switching  of a capacitor  to the appropriate resistor (integration over  a(x) +&amp;IX(X)!), one would not  intuitively expect  that in  the case  of  the  impedance perpendicular to  the  interface, but  has  nevertheless been found to  be  a  good approximation in  many  experiments  (cf. [9]) (see equivalent circuit diagram Fig.  63).

Figure  64  illustrates the  results of  measurements on a  bicrystal. Apart  from the  bulk  semicircle at high  frequency  it is also  possible to  recognize a  low frequency  semicircle which takes  into  account the  transfer impedance through the  interface. The latter disappears by intermediate annealing, the former does not.  The  comparably low capacitance  of  the  interfacial effect rules out space  charge depletion  layers but  is fully consistent with  'current narrowing  effects' [9,78,79]. Such a  bicrystal experiment  cannot be  used  to  demonstrate  a  possible increased parallel conductivity in  the  case  of silver halides; the  effect is too small  for  this.

However, the  situation is  different in  the  case  of  polycrystalline material. Here the  portion  of both parallel and perpendicular  paths  is  considerable, and the  superposition of  all the  effects is complex. If  the  topology  given  in  Fig. 65  is taken  as  a  first approximation,  the  bulk  and boundary layers can -  as  described in  detail in  Chapter 2  -  be  described by Eq. (35)  [9].

On account  of  the  symmetry  of  translation of  the  brick-layer model the  corresponding  equivalent circuit diagram is  simply  represented by Fig.  63.  (The grain  boundary  elements  can be split into core  and space  charge  elements  as  described in  [9].) A s  in  the  two-phase  mixtures  the  capacitance of  the  parallel paths  can be regarded  as  being  very  small.

Here it has  been assumed that the  relaxation times (T =  EEO  /  a) for the  bulk, space  charge  zone  and core  region  increase in  this order  and are  well  separated from each  other  (In a  better approximation the  specific nature  of  the  crossing points  has  to  be  considered.).

Figure  66 illustrates the  impedance spectroscopic analysis (see first 2 plot) of  freshly prepared AgCl at  25°C.  Two  semicircles can be  seen  as  in  the  case  of  the  bicrystal experiment.  If the  sample here  is also  annealed  at  400°C and cooled,  the  remeasurement reveals -  at  the  first glance  surprisingly -  that the  right-hand semicircle has  become, as  expected, smaller (mainly  grain  growth); but the  left-hand semicircle has  increased [9]. This  divergence in  the  behavior  can only  be  explained  by assuming  that in  the  fresh sample  highly conducting  parallel layers (parallel to  the  bulk)  contribute significantly to  the  high  frequency  semicircle and that  these disappear  with  heat  treatment  (as  the perpendicular  blocking  boundaries  do).  At the  same time  the  capacity of  the  high  frequency  process remains  unaffected (see diameter  of  B plot). This  confirms  the  expected  anisotropy of  the  grain boundary  in  a  very  impressive manner  and in  particular -  on account  of  the  activation energy  the  space  charge  zone as  a  conduction  path.

These reflections are  supported  by a  quantitative analysis:

- (1) The maximum frequency of  the  high  frequency  semicircle actually yields the  bulk dielectric constant.
- (2) If  such  an E  value  is also  assumed as  an approximation for  the  grain  boundary  region  (low frequency branch),  then Eq. (63)  yields a effective grain  boundary  thickness of 10  A, that suggests a  blockade by the  actual grain  boundary  core  (possibly with  participation of  the  VI  transition). Obviously bad contact  effects as  observed  in  the  bicrystal experiment  are  less serious.
- (3) The conductivity  values  of  samples  prepared  in  the  same manner  (~'0 = const)  can be correlated approximately  with the  grain  size according  to  Eq. (28, 35)  [4] (see  also  Fig. 67),  so that  it is  not  necessary  to  introduce  additional effects by way of  explanation, even though it is probable  that  they  occur [60,4,9,13] and allow  further refinement  of  the  data.  The experimental curves  can then  be described  quantitatively by c,s values  that are  about one order  of magnitude below those  for  heterogeneously  doped samples  in  agreement with  the  previous chapter.

As can  be  seen  from Fig. 67  grain boundary effects can  nearly reach  the  same order  of  magnitude as  two-phase effects. The lower  and less T-dependent values  of  C,O and Q)L  mean, however,  that  the conductivity increases are  usually  smaller and react  sensitively on annealing, whereas in  the  case of  the  two-phase mixtures  the  particles of  Al203 fix the  interface density, determine  and enhance the  interfacial potential. We  found the  strongest grain  boundary effect (Fig. 67)  with  respect to  c,s in  a  AgCl material prepared  by decomposing the  diamine  complex (Ag(NH&amp;Cl). Evidently  some NH3  remains  adsorbed at  the  grain  boundaries  in  spite of  the  temperature  of  preparation, this -not unexpectedly  -  like the  OH groups in  Al203 acts  as  a  nucleophile on account of  its single lone  pair  of  electrons and can stabilize Ag+  ions  according  to

Figure  67 shows that  conductivity  levels are  higher  than for  a sample of  comparable grain  size, prepared  by chlorinating Ag particles, and can,  like Al203 samples, be  described in  terms  of  a  saturation  effect. The  differences disappear  within  a heating/cooling cycle. Of the  same significance for  the  interpretation are  very  recent  results [56] suggesting an enhanced Vk conduction in  polycrystalline CaF2 and PbF2 by activating the  grains with  SbFs which provides a  strong  attractor for F--ions. The impedance measurements also  provide  a  nice  configuration of  the  equivalent circuit: The first semicircle shows the  vacancy migration  energy (space  charge)  and the  second the  bulk activation energy (current narrowing).

In very fine-grained AgCl  samples (0,x)  at  lower temperatures  (see  Fig.  67)  we  observe an additional flattening of  the  curve  in  the  Arrhenius  presentation, that is not  attributable to  electronic

## 5. THE INTERFACE IONIC CONDUCTOR/GAS (A NEW SENSOR PRINCIPLE  FOR ACID-BASE ACTIVE  GASES)

The above considerations with  respect to  the  ammonia  effect are  fully confirmed  by  experiments of  thin  films exposed to  NHs.  In  epitaxial films on various  substrates [ 171 is a  completely  analogous increase in  the  conductivity of  the  AgCl phase  in  the  low temperature  region. As is to  be  expected from the  electronic structure of  the  gas  molecule  and the  chemistry  of  silver, the  same effect is also observed  with  (02 (INC - CNI) (Fig. 68).

If  for  the  sake  of  a  higher  effect, free-standing very  porous thin  films are  used, the  overall effect is a  reduction  of  conductivity due to  series effects. It is, however,  not  yet  certain whether  this effect is  actually attributable to  a  V-I  transition or  to  core  processes. There is  a  conductivity reduction also  in  the  intrinsic region  at  higher  temperatures, at  which  interstitial conduction  predominates. In any case  this effect can be used  as  a  new sensor  principle to  detect acid-base active gases  [17,102]. Figure  69  shows  the  anology to  the  conventional boundary sensors for  the  detection of  redox-active gases  in  a  thermochemical and a  semiconductor-like boundary picture.

Figure  70 illustrates the  single-valued dependence of  the  NH3  pressure and the  reversibility of the  response. It  was not  our  ambition  to  optimize the  response  time  of  the  signal, however,  a  much faster response  time  (- 10s) can be achieved  by using  microelectrodes [79].

The  quantitative relation between the  conductance change and the  ammonia pressure  can be approximately described  by a simple  pathmodel: a series switching  of heterogeneous  pathways, each consisting of elements  which are  non-available for  NH3 (resistivity p),  of  those  which are available for  NH3 but not occupied (p*)  and of  elements  which are  occupied by NH3 (p'). The path  resistance then  is given  [17] by

where A is the  cross  section of  the  path  and x the  width  of  one site (free or  occupied), N = $  total sites, Nk  =  # sites available for  adsorption, Nk= = $4 sites occupied  by NH3.  If  P is the  equilibrium NH3 pressure, AR, the  maximum resistance change (i.e. AR  for  P 03,  saturation), then the relationship AR(P)  is given  by

Bottom  row: The  interfacial effect of an adsorbed acid-base  active gas on mobile cations, compared  with the  effect of redox-active gases  (here  oxidizing) on electronic carriers. The situation is  represented in  a  thermochemical  language  (p, /J, 4) and in  a  semiconductor-like picture using  energy  and Fermi-levels corresponding  to  p' and fi  functions. The r.h.s. column shows the  changes in  the  conductivity (i, v denote interstitial and vacancy defects; p,  n denote electron hole  and conduction  electron).

This  adsorption  of  silver ions  by nucleophilic gas  molecules  is analogous  to  the  electron capture process  of  chemisorbed redox active gases  (e.g. 02) in  oxide  semiconductors. As mentioned in  the previous  section, we are  investigating the  influence of  SbFs vapor and of  BF3 (strong Lewis-acid) vapor on the  conductivity of  thin film  of  CaF2.

Useful  relationships for  boundary  sensors as  derived from the  space  charge  concept  outlined in this paper,  are  given  in  Appendix  3.

## 6.  NANOSYSTEMS (MESOSCOPIC IONIC  CONDUCTIVITY EFFECTS)

There are two reasons  why  space charge effects ought to occur more  strongly  if  the (ionic conductor)  particles, which until now have  always  been  assumed to  be  large in  comparison with  the Debye  length, are  made  successively smaller, or  if the  thickness of  conductive  films is successively reduced:

- (1)  Trivially, the  portion  of  the  boundary  layer  increases.
- (2)  The behaviour  changes  qualitatively in  the  case  of  very  small  dimensions.

The latter point  is of  fundamental  importance  for the  understanding  of  nanosystems  (extremely thin films, nanocrystalline materials, high  densities of dislocations, grain  boundaries,  high interfacial densities in  heterogeneously  doped materials (high  Al203 concentrations)) [ 10,12,13].

This  is illustrated for  a  symmetrical  film of  thickness L in  Fig. 7  1. The defect profile in  the  centre of  the  sample approaches  the  bulk  value  as  long  as  L approximately  remains  &gt; 4h ; this no longer applies if  L falls below - 4h,  the  sample is then  charged  throughout and considerably influenced by the  boundary  phase.  This  means mathematically  that  the  boundary  conditions  are  no longer semi-infinite but are  finite in  both directions. The influence of the  right-hand  boundary  layer  is experienced  even in  the  immediate context  of  the  left-hand boundary layer. The influence of  these effects on the  parallel conductivity will be considered  below.  The  published  literature contains  a whole range of  experimental  evidence  on this topic  but  no satisfactory quantitative approach.  In what follows  an ideal linear problem (Fig. 71)  will be assumed for  this purpose.  (It is  critical to

Fig.  70.  The  resistance changes of porous free-standing AgCl-films  as a response  to  different NH3 partial pressures as  a function  of  time. The response  of  (CN)2 is  also  shown. The insert indicates that  the  stationary response  excitation relationship can be understood by a Langmuiradsorption  (K:  mass action  constant; AR: stationary resistance change upon exposition to  NH3; the  lower  index  m  refers to  the  saturation pressure).

note that  fulfilment of  the  approximations  made, such as  structural invariance, neglect of  elastic effects on thermodynamic  and transport properties, may  be dubious  at  such  small  dimensions.)

For mathematical reasons  a symmetrical film  is  assumed  with the  limits x = 0 and x = L (?&amp; = i&amp;) for  the  calculation. The relative concentration  in  the  centre  of  the  sample (x* = 4, z* = L/2h) would be g*.  The first integration of  the  Poisson-Boltzmann differential equation  can still be carried out analytically -assuming two majority  charge  carriers 0'  = 1,2) with  the  same absolute  charge  (z  = zr  = -22). We  obtain  [lOa,12]

where c; and &lt;jo  are  implicitly related to  each  other  via  $* = L/2h  according  to

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Elliptical integrals of the  first order are designated f here [lo]. (In  a very limited  number  of cases  (sufficently large  samples,  see  [lo]) it  is  also  possible  to approximate g*  by superposing  the  electrical potentials of two undistorted  profiles [125], from which it  follows  that  &lt;T  = exp  [89jsign(zj) exp(-LIZA)]).

For small  effects IYol  = 1 &amp;I  - t&amp;  1  /(RT) K 1  or 5 CK  e)  it is  possible to  integrate Eq. (67) further after Taylor  expansion  with  the  result [10,12]

The corresponding  conductivity increase as  a  function  of  the  film  thickness is  given  by (whereby 21.2 = f-2)

The last term in  Eq.  (70)  is important  in  the  case  where  defects 1  and 2  have  similar mobility. Aa, is  always  positive under these  conditions. In  the  normal case  of  different u values  (e.g. UI  z+  ~2) and for  values  of L that  are  not  too  large the  equation  simplifies to  [lo]

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Even though the  equation  for  small  effects is  not  very  relevant to  our aims,  it does exhibit the intuitively expected  variation of  Aa,! with L  (see also  Fig.  73~).

Unfortunately  it is not  possible to  produce a  rigorous explicit solution for  the  case  of  large effects (510  &gt; e)  that  is  more  important in  practice. However, the  following  procedure is  possible: The deviation from the  bulk  values of  the  concentration of  defect 1  (cl) that will be regarded  arbitrarily here  as  the  enriched  defect, will be  approximated by  the  difference from concentration value  of  the counter  defect  (~2). The variation of  the  two concentrations and the  quality of  the  approximation (for a  very  unfavourable  situation) is shown in  Fig. 72.  For  not  too  thin  films (L  2 4h)  the  relative error  is given  by [lOa]

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The  reason that  this  approximation is  serviceable for  large  effects is  that  coo  and c2  can be neglected  close to  the  interface while  at  large distances from the  interface c2  approaches cm = czrn because  of  the  condition  of  electrical neutrality. Since

the  calculation of  AU,,, only  requires knowledge of  the  first differential of  4 at  x = 0 . This  yields [lo] the  important  relation

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

whereby c: is  accessible via  Eq. (68).

Figure  73 reveals various  potentialities of the Y-L characteristics. When there  are  negligible interfacial effects, the  defect  profile is  a  horizontal  line. The conductivity (a  Yll  = Lam)  is  proportional  to  the  film  thickness (case  I). The Y-L curve  still remains  a  line if  space  charge  effects become  appreciable  (i.e. large  effects or smaller  film  thickness) but it  is  displaced in  a parallel manner. The space  charge  contribution appears  as  a  finite intercept (case II). This  overall value  is naturally identical with  the  value  which  is infinite in  one  direction according  to  Eq.  (22), that  is approximated for  large effects (just as  Eq.  (75)) for  c* -K  c,)  by Eq.  (28)  (Yll = La, +const.ul,/?$. If L I 4 then it  is not only the  bulk  value  that  is  affected by the  thickness variation and in  the ideal case  the  characteristics vary  in  the  complicated  manner  shown in  Fig.  73  bottom  (case  III). (Y/i N La,  + const.ul  cl0 - c, (L)). 7

It  is worth mentioning that  the  different cases  may  be  observed  by considering different contact phases  (at  constant L) but  also  with  a  given  contact  phase  when  successively increasing the  local resolution.

In the following  text  different literature results are  discussed  reflecting the above-mentioned cases. Figure  74  shows an experimental  example of  normal bulk  behaviour  corresponding  to  case I. A plot  is illustrated of  the  conductivity of  a  LiI  film on a  SiO2  substrate investigated by us  [15]. Surprisingly a  hexagonal  modification [15] is found for  evaporated  films (on  account  of  the  ratios of the  radii the  normal cubic  modification lies at  the  edge  of  stability!), that gentle annealing  (&gt; 85'C) and pressure  increase (2 10m3atm)  change irreversibly to  the  usual  rock-salt structure. As is to  be expected  from the  discussion in  Chapter 2.3.7, it is  not  possible to  detect  an appreciable surface effect at  least at  this resolution (the  layer  thickness increases by -35 nm/min). Stability, structure and conductivity considerations show that  the  bulk  of  the  hexagonal  phase  is not responsible for u effect in  LiI/oxide dispersions [15].

Several  authors have observed a weak, constant  surface  effect (not  comparable with the yAl203  effects in  the  dispersions) in  evaporated AgCl  and AgBr  films  (usually mica or NaCl), that  is  dependent on substrate, orientation and temperature  [126-1301 as  shown  in  Fig.  75.  This corresponds  to  case  II. It  has  to  be  mentioned again  how  important  careful annealing  is to  obtain

Fig. 72. Profile (91 &gt;  0) of  the concentrations of  the  majority charge carrier, their difference and the excess value [lOa].

Fig.  73.  Dependence  of  the  normalized  parallel conductivity (Y'  = CT,!&amp;) on the  film  thickness: a)  (in  contrast to  b,  c)  no boundary effect detectable; b)  film  thickness large in  comparison with the  extent  of  the  boundary layer; c)  film  thickness comparable with  the  Debye  length  [IO,1 31.

reliable stationary values. This  is especially stressed by Ref. [ 13  1] and is analogous  to  the  situation in  freshly prepared  ceramics  and composites.

N. Starbov [129]  in  particular has evaluated  a series of such results -  by application of the Kliewer  model -  in  order  to  obtain  individual defect parameters. In  his experiments, due to  careful annealing  the  bulk  conductivity of  AgCl-films  is very  close to  that  observed  in  single crystals (in contrast to  other  authors), so  that here  equilibrium conditions may be  assumed.  However, incorrect relationships were used  for  evaluation due to  a  lacking  quantitative theory.

Reconsideration  [lob] by us  according  to  the  above  space  charge  theory  outlined here  now yields a fair agreement with  the  data  of  Farlow et  al. [87] for  a 'free'  surface obtained  by the  profile analysis using  the  signal of 54Mn&amp;-defects, as  described  in  Chapter 2.5.4 (see  Table 1  for  (111) surface). Slight  differences remain not least because of interactions with the  substrate (see  Eq. (41)) [4,14]. Large interactions as  in  the  case  of  y-Al203 are  not  expected. It  should  be  mentioned, however, that  a very recent  reevaluation of the  tracer data  resulted in  somewhat  different data [90]. Also,  recent  experiments  on AgCl  surfaces in  our laboratory  are  not fully consistent with the  assumption of  an Agi-accumulation  at  AgCl-surfaces  [132,133]. More  careful experiments  are needed to  clarify this problem.  The possible difference in  mechanism  compared  to  the  AgCI/A1203 dispersions, however,  is not  a  problem at  all.

In  this context  it should be mentioned that  in  completely  analogous experiments  on the  electronically conducting  ZnO  films, whose conductivity has  also been measured as  a  function  of  the partial pressure  of  oxygen,  Gdpel and Lampe  [134] were able  to  obtain  bulk  and interfacial conductivities as  a  function  of  temperature  and partial pressure of  oxygen (P). In  the  case  of  the  bulk it was found that  a 0~ P-'14, which corresponds  to  a  simple  defect model in  the  case  of  acceptor doped material, while  a characteristic exponent of  -0.15+  0.03  was obtained  for  the  interface. If the  experimentally determined space  charge  potential and a  low mobility  for  the  extrinsic (acceptor)  defects is  assumed then  it is  simple  from Eq. (38)  (compensating  influence between effective concentration  and effective thickness) to  derive  an exponent of  -l/8=-0.13 that  lies very close  to

## that  observed  [3e]. (see Table  II)

But back to  our ionic  conductors:  Very recent experiments  by Schreck  et  al. [135] suggest  that these  authors  have  also been able  to  make  measurements in  the  extreme  region  of  very  thin  layers of  LiI  (evaporated  onto sapphire), whose expected  conductivity characteristics are  reproduced in the  lower  curve  in  Fig.  73 (case III). The experimental  results of  these  authors  are  reproduced in Fig.  76;  the  similarity with  the  expected  curve  is very  evident.

Fig. 76.  Theoretical  fitting of the conductivity data for LiI layers  on  sapphire  after  [135] by assumption of ideal  interfacial behaviour  and the  approximation  of symmetrical  boundary conditions [lOa].

As revealed  by the  results of  our numerical  analysis in  Fig. 76  the  space  charge  model that  has been developed provides  a good  description of  the  results [lo]  when  the  parameters 7&amp;s  (v  here means  Li vacancy) and h are  set  at  &amp; = 20 and h = 62OA. It  is  implicitly assumed here that approximately  symmetrical  boundary  conditions can be  introduced  on account of  the  low activity of  the  sapphire (see  above).

In  Fig.  77  the  defect concentration  in  the  centre  of  the  sample  is plotted  against film  thickness in  order  to  illustrate the  thin-film effects. The transition to  the  actual region  of  nano-size  effects is visible at  x E 4h.

The first of  the  values  obtained  above, corresponding  to  a  interfacial potential of  75  mV, certainly corresponds  to  the  expectations for  an inert phase  such  as  sapphire. The obtained  value  of  620 2 for  the  Debye  length  is only  reasonable  for  an extremely  pure sample and would be amply large enough to  interpret the  results in  LiI:AlzOs  dispersions consistently. The activation energy  for  thin film  conduction is very  similar to  that in  the  dispersions, which in  general indicates that  for  LiI  the temperature  sensitivity of  the  interfacial concentration is very  low.  The attributing of  the  results of the  measurement  by Phipps  et  al. [41,42,136] on LiI/SiOz, which revealed a  much  lower  activation

energy, to  a  qualitatively different interfacial pathway * is consistent with  this.

Nevertheless, if the  Debye  length obtained  is used  to  calculate charge  carrier concentrations and then mobilities are  calculated via  the  measured  specific conductivities then the  results obtained are  comparable with  those  for  silver halides but  about  two orders  of  magnitude greater than  those determined by doping experiments  t . Unfortunately  it is not  possible to  decide  conclusively which result is  the  more  reliable. What  is certain is  that  the  large apparent  h-values are  not  artefacts of the  assumption of  symmetrical  boundary  conditions involved  or  the  approximations  made  in  the derivation of  Eq.  (75). Probably  island formation  and other  possible non-ideal conditions, such  as the  presence  of  grain  boundaries, dislocations, or  non-equilibrium bulk  structures may  be  involved as  in  the  case  of  the  thin-layer experiments  described  [15].

On  the other hand  doubts have already  been expressed  concerning the  doping experiments. It  seems rather  odd that  the  enthalpy  gradation  of  the  Schottky  defect reaction  for  LiI  deviates significantly from both the  CsI-RbI-KI-NaI-LiI series and the  LiF-LiCl-LiBr-LiI  series [137] and from the  correlation to  the  melting  point  [127].

An interesting application of  nano-effects that  has  already been mentioned occurs  in  micropolycrystalline systems  where the  grain  size is comparable to  or  even less than the  Debye  length  (see Fig.  78a).

It  is  possible to define  a 'nano-size  factor'  (g)  [12] that  describes the  ratio between the  true conductivity  increase to the value  obtainable  using  semi-finite boundary  conditions. For large effects (symmetrical  boundary  conditions, linear problem) [12] this becomes:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

and can be calculated numerically  for  given  values of  h  IL  and co/cm with  the  aid  of  Eq.  (61). The numerical  result will not  be  dealt with  here, rather the  following estimate will be  made: If the  effect is  large and the  film  thickness is  not very  much  smaller than the  Debye  length, then  g = 4h /L. If  L = 0.4h  ,  e.g. the  conductivity is increased by a further order  of  magnitude,  under the  above idealized conditions.

Such nano-effects are  probably  responsible for  the  increased a-values  of  nanocrystalline AgCl samples  at  lower  temperatures  (see Fig.  67;  0,x). At such  temperatures  a  comparatively  high  h /L

* On  account of  the  extremely  low surface  activity of  the  silicon dioxide  used  this is  in  agreement  with  the  discussion in  Chapter 2.5,  2.5.3. In addition  it must be considered  that  these  authors  used point  electrodes, but evaluated  the experimental  results in  a  conventional manner  taking  account  of  a simple  cell constant.

t See  [lOa] for  a  more  precise discussion.

value  can  result from the  association of  intrinsic and extrinsic  harge  carriers and/or  as  a  result of a  high  disclocation density. Since  at  these temperatures  the  temperature  dependence of  h ought to be determined by the  negative enthalpy  of  association, it is possible that  the  negative temperature coefficient of  the  specific  onductivity at  low temperature  sometimes reported  in  the  literature may be attributable to  such  effects.

The above influences ought to  play  a role in  two-phase  mixtures  at  high  A1203 concentrations and be partially responsible for  some quantitative discrepancies (see  Chapter 2.3.12). Assuming  a typical surface  density  of 100 m2 /g for  y-Al203 and complete wetting  in  a  two-phase  mixture  of LiI:  4Ow/o y-Al203 would result in  a  mean  oxide  separation of  ca. 50  A!

Starting  from  these  considerations we have developed a method  of deliberately preparing  a nano-sized  two-phase  system  AgBr:y-Al203 by  coprecipitation of  Al(OH)3 and  AgBr  ([Ag(NH3)Br + Al(N03)3] solution  + (NH4)Br  solution). However, disadvantageous  agglomeration  has  so far prevented us from preparing  a sample that  was superior  to a conventional  one with respect  to conductivity.

Two-phase  mixtures  or  heterostructures containing  two coexisting Frenkel  defective ionic  conductors  are  probably more  promising,  since  here  the  phase distribution may  prevent  the  grains from growing.  The expected  defect chemical  behaviour  is indicated in  Fig.  78b.

In  this context  a  very  recent impedance study  of  highly conducting  nanocrystalline CaF2  (grain size -  10  nm)  has  to  be  mentioned,  too [138].

## 7. OUTLOOK

As can  be  seen  from the  considerations discussed above,  the  'heterogeneous  doping' mechanism yields  strong  effects when  the  concentration  of  charge  carriers in  the  pure material is  relatively low and the  mobility  relatively high.  The  second phase must possess  a suitable surface  activity (1 J Ai &gt; A .G large if it is an insulating phase,  while  in  the  case  of  two ionic conductors  the  standard chemical  potentials of  the  relevant defects (and  thus  AiGL,)  must be sufficiently different. Taking realistic values  for  molar volume,  volume fraction and possible grain  size as  well as  for  the  dielectric constant  (non-ferroelectric compounds)  a crude estimate  reveals that  the  conductivity  effect achievable in  R-'cm-i  has  the  same order  of  magnitude as  the  mobility  of  the  enriched  defect  in cm2V-ls-l.

(Here  effects stemming from the  discreteness of  the  profiles (see chapter  2.3.6) or  from the  smallness of  the  system  (6) leading to  additional enhancements have  been  neglected.) From this it follows that (in  the  absence  of  strong  structural effects and nano-size  effects) 'superionic conductors'  cannot be created as  a  result of  the  ideal heterogeneous  doping effect, but  that  all conductivity properties and all properties that  are  influenced by defect concentrations can be  changed and controlled. The above mechanism  also  allows  non-stoichiometries to  be  created in  the  boundary  regions, which it is  not possible to  extend  into  the  bulk.  Beyond  that  an extension  of  preparation into  the  nanosize  range  and also  making  use  of  possible structural effects, in  particular those  leading  to  new interphases, can result in  further  surprises.

This  is of  particular importance for  sensor  applications:

- (a) The effect of  gases  on the  surface potential can  provide  information  concerning  their concentration as  a  result of  space  charge  effects due to  the  chemical  interaction. This  principle constitutes the  ionic conductor analogue  of  the  well-known semiconductor surface sensor  mode. While the  latter refers to  the  detection of  redox activity, here  it is -  in  the  general  sense  acid-base activity that  is decisive.
- (b) The transfer resistance, which plays  a  decisive role  in  the  response  and selectivity of  electrochemical  sensors -particularly at  lower  temperatures -  (and  often  has  a  limiting effect in battery-powered  systems), is largely controlled by the  defect concentration at  the  interface, so that  the  incorporation  of  suitable heterogeneity (e.g. multilayers, nanosystems) ought to  be able  to  bring  about a  reduction  of  the  transfer resistance.

Space charge  layers are  also  of  similar importance for  other  elementary  processes, such  as  the sorption  steps, that  play  an important role  in  heterogeneous  catalysis in  particular (cf. current experiments  in  the  field of  organic  elimination reactions, Chapter 2.5.4).

The  importance of  (electronic) space  charges  for  chemical  reactions was recognized  very  early on,  but  in  our opinion  its full importance has  never  been  properly  appreciated. In  the  case  of  solid state reactions reacting particles perceive the  boundary layer right up to  complete  consumption especially in  this final phase of  the  reaction (see Chapter 6). Similarly, space  charge  effects should play  an eminent role  in  chemical  transport along  interfaces, creep  and sintering phenomena.

Other observations  indicate considerable two-phase effects in  the  efficacy of photoelectrodes [139].

Put crudely, taking  account of heterogeneities and in  particular of  multiphase  systems  in  ion conductivity  research wins a 'practical' degree  of  freedom for  materials research. If  we consider the  great  advances reached  by the  preparation  of small  particles and microstructuring that  have been made  in  the  field of thin-film technology in  particular we must expect  further  interesting developments in  this field in  the  future.

## 8.  SUMMARY

The  defect  chemistry  of boundary  layers  (i.e. the  potentials, defect  concentrations  and nonstoichiometries as  a function  of position, temperature  and component  activity) for  the  case  of 'dilute solutions' and structural invariance has  been investigated with  the  aid  of  defect  chemical equilibria and the  Poisson  equation, while  taking  into  account  a  chemical  coupling  to  the  contact phase. Particular emphasis  has  been  given to  ionic conduction  -  although  the  relationships derived are  applicable to  other  defect pairs and provide  a  generalization for the  case of  the  mixed conductor. On  account of  the  three  contact  problems that  are  treated, (i) ionic conductor/insulator, (ii) ionic conductor l/ionic conductor 2,  (iii) ionic  conductor l/ionic conductor 1  (grain boundary), three distribution processes are  discussed:

- (i)  unilateral transfer of  defects from and to  the  insulator boundary,
- (ii) transfer of  defects from on ionic  conductor boundary  layer to  that of  its neighbour,
- (iii) bilateral transfer of  defects to  or  from the  grain  boundary.

In  all cases  it is possible to  define not  only  the  profile of  the  majority  charge  carrier but  also  that of  the  minority  charge  carrier. The  interfacial interactions are  taken  into  account in  an interaction  parameter,  denoted as  'degree  of  influence', that  can be based  on standard  thermodynamic quantities in  the  framework  of  an interfacial model. This  makes it possible to  construct  Brouwer diagrams for  boundary  layers and more generally a  defect chemistry  of  boundary  regions.

It was possible to  determine  the  conductivity contribution of  the  space  charge  zones  parallel and -  less precisely -  perpendicular  to  the  interface in  all cases; these  results are  used to  interpret experiments  involving defined  contacts.

In  order  to  be able  to  compare  the  results with  the  author's experiments  and with  other  experimental  results from the  literature, calculations were made  of  the  effective specific conductivities of  heterogeneous  systems  (two-phase  mixtures, polycrystalline materials). The simple  distribution topology assumed  not only makes  it  possible to derive  analytical expressions, it  is  also  realistic on the  basis of  interfacial interaction and particle size distribution and fulfilled to  a  satisfactory degree  (at least in  our experiments), as  revealed by microstructure investigations.

The relationship obtained  makes it possible to  explain in  a  quantitative manner  the  increase in conductivity of  two-phase  mixtures  (particularly ionic conductor-Al203  dispersions) that have  been the  subject of  so  much  discussion in  the  literature. The dependence on grain  size, volume fraction, surface  activity and temperature  can be described. Furthermore, the  frequency distribution of impedance measurements can also  be  understood.

If  a  saturation effect is assumed it is possible to  describe the  absolute values quantitatively in  the case  of  our experiments  with  AgCl  and AgBr  for  which all the  necessary parameters  are  known.

In  agreement with  this model of  'heterogeneous  doping' we have  found that  the  chloride ionic conductor TlCl is converted  to  a  Tl+  conductor at  lower  temperatures  by the  addition of  Al203 (a sufficient creation of  thallium(I) vacancies). Here too  it is possible to  describe the  results -with a lower  interfacial concentration, but  a  similar space  charge  potential -  for  various particle sizes and volume  fractions over the  whole temperature  range.  Comparative experiments  with  PbC12 throw light (in  agreement with  the  calculations) on the  similarities and differences in  principle between the  (classical) homogeneous doping and heterogeneous  doping (as  described  here). Experiments on both homogeneously  and heterogeneously  doped materials could  be interpreted.

The various  possible concentration  and conductivity profiles (enrichment, depletion, inversion layers) and the occurrence  of ionic  P-N  transitions (e.g. vacancy-interstitial transitions) are  discussed  as  a function  of  the  graduation  of  the  mobilities of the  defects involved  and the  type of disorder.

Due  to  the  enhanced defect  concentrations such  composite electrolytes have been shown  to  be efficient heterogeneous  catalysts for  organic  reactions. As for  the  conductivity the  rate  constant can be quantitatively expressed  in  terms  of  space  charge  effects.

Variation of  the  insulating compound,  the  use  of  various  modifications and changing  its surface activity by means  of  chemical  pretreatment  make  it  possible to  draw conclusions  concerning  the defect-inducing interfacial mechanism. These and other  experiments  published in  the  literature can be explained  consistently if it is assumed that  the  free  pairs of  electrons of  OH-groups  enable  the latter to  act  as  nucleophilic groups  for  the  stabilizing interaction with  cations. The analogy  with  the effect of  OH-groups  of  solids in  contact  with  aqueous solutions is very  evident. Further  support  is provided  by the  observed  dependence of  the  conductivity effect on the  basicity of  the  M-OH unit.

Wetting  experiments  on various  substrates (various oxides, various  crystallographic planes) with molten AgCl  are  in  complete agreement  with  the  mechanism  assumed.

The same also  applies to  our demonstration  that  similarly nucleophilic molecules  such  as  NH3 and (CN)2 exert  a  significant conductivity effect.

This makes  it  possible to extend the  arguments to the ionic  conductor/gas  interface and to construct novel  chemical  sensors that  can  measure the  partial pressure of  complex acid-base active gases.

Comparable  experiments  with respect  to modifying the  properties of fluoride conductors by appropriate  solid, liquid or  gaseous  phases  are  described.

Alternative models for  explanation and the  application of  further experimental  methods are  the subject of  detailed discussion. In  particular impurity  effects are  excluded  in  the  case  of  AgCl  and

AgBr  on the  basis of  detailed experiments.

The use  of  surface active electronically conducting  oxides  (e.g. RuOl, Nb20s) allowed  us  to  study single ionic  space  charge  layers by impedance spectroscopy. Particularly conclusive are  the  temperature  changes of  the  resistive and capacitive part  of  the  interfacial response  upon temperature. Microelectrode  impedance  methods  and a 'penetration impedance  method'  allow  for  a higher sensitivity in  this respect.

The analysis of  the  Wagner-Hebb technique  is extended  to  two-phase  systems  with  space charge zones  and makes it possible to  determine  the  electronic charge  carrier in  AgCI:A1203.  We succeeded in  explaining the  simultaneous  increase in  n-  and p-conduction  (also observed  for  &amp;AgI  [loll). A further extension  enables us  for  the  first time  to  give  a  quantitative picture of  the  complete  defect chemistry  of  an ionic  solid which includes boundary effects.

The increase in  conductivity can also  be  calculated and related to  standard  values in  the  case  of contact  between two ionic conductors. An  estimate enables us  to  interpret reasonably  the  increase in  conductivity  reported  in  the  literature for  the  miscibility gap in  the  system /GAgI-AgBr.  A combined  impedance  spectroscopic and microstructural study let  us understand details of the conduction pathway (hetero-, homojunctions)  in  AgI-AgCI  two phase  mixtures.

Our experimental  results on pure,  polycrystalline ionic conductors  (AgCl,  AgBr  and TlCl)  support  the  conclusion  that the  processes related to  two-phase  effects occur  at the  grain  boundaries, i.e. -  highly  conducting  (parallel) contributions as  a  result of  space  charge  zones  in  the  environment of  the  grain  boundaries  in  addition to  the  'normal' blocking  influence of  these higher  dimensional defects (in the  perpendicular direction). On the  basis of  the  activation energies it is to  be  presumed that  (on account of structural peculiarities or impurities that  have separated  out)  in  these  compounds cations  accumulate in  the  core  and vacancies are  enriched  in  the  space  charge  zone.  Here too it is  possible to  calculate the  specific effective conductivity and the  specific impedance of  biand polycrystalline samples.  The evaluation of  the  impedance measurements,  provides  significant confirmation  of  these  presumptions  and may  clarify a  number  of  hitherto mysterious  phenomena reported  in  the  literature. The adsorption  of  NH3 to  the  grain  boundaries  increases the  effect in absolute  agreement with  model predictions.

In addition  an investigation has been made  in  this work  of the  consequences of a successive reduction  of sample size on defect  chemistry  and conductivity. Since  for  very small  dimensions the  defect  profile no longer  extends  to  the  bulk  value, account has to be taken  of complicated finite boundary  conditions  (corresponding  to  a higher  sensitivity to  neighbouring  phases). Here too it proved possible for  the  first time  to  provide  closed  expressions for  the  relevant conductivity contributions, allowing  a  posteriori explanation  of  thin  film  results. In  this way,  individual defect parameters could be precisely evaluated. Mesoscalic  effects -  described by a 'nano-size  factor' -  result in  additional conductivity effects beyond the  space  charge  contributions discussed above. Also interfacial phase transitions preceding  bulk  effects have  to  be  taken  account  of.

To  make  a long story  short:  This article should have made  clear, that  the  establishment of a consistent defect  chemistry of boundary  regions  is  possible in  a first approximation,  that  it can explain  many anomalies,  especially with respect  to conductivity  (but  also  with respect  to chemical  kinetics catalysis, sensor  and sintering science), and that it can be  used  in  further studies to  design  materials systems  with  special properties. Much  refinement  is  possible and I  apologize to  many  colleagues for  not  having  been able to  adequately  appreciate all the  detailed work in  this 'inhomogeneous  field'.

about a  depletion of  the  space  charge  zones  as  a  result of  electron capture  (e.g. 0;) [140]. The variation of  the  defect  concentrations for  the  bulk  (thick line) and boundary  layer  (thinner line: x/h = const;  thinnest line: const  = 0)  is illustrated schematically in  Fig.  84.

Since  it is  also  possible to determine  the  electrical potential at  a  constant  site within  the space  charge  zone from the  equilibrium conditions (Eq.  (4)) (see also  Figs. 79,  8), the  law  of mass action

applies to  all x 2 0 (insofar as  it is possible to  assume Boltzmann  distribution). On  account of  the  sign  of  the  band bending it can be seen  that  the  relative change in  the  concentration of  oxygen vacancies  in  the  boundary  layers with  the  partial pressure of  oxygen is  negligible at  even lower partial pressures (i.e. [V;;] 2:  const  in  Eq. (78)), than is  possible in  the  bulk (extension of  the  -l/4 region).

The  'distance  law' In  [Vo'], - In [VO'], =  2 (In [e'l, - In  [e'l,)  (cf. Fig.  8,  Eq. (4))  is automatically obeyed by Eq. (78). The effective contribution to  the  specific  onductivity for such  a  depletion layer  is described  by Eq. (29) for  large effects. It  follows that

(moo  and 1110 are  the  characteristic exponents  for x=00 and x = 0  as  in  Fig.  84). If  both  coincide then exactly  half  of the  exponent for  the  bulk would  be expected  for  the  boundary  layer conductivity [102]. The reason  for  this lies in  the  interaction of  effective thickness (h  CC  c;~'~) and effective charge  carrier concentration -  as  already  explained in  the  text for  the  example of  ZnO (Chapter  6)  (see  [14]).

- (3) Conductivity-partial pressure characteristics inboundary layer sensors [102]: The space  charge effect can be  characterized by:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The  chemical effect is  hidden in  9,  the  'degree  of influence' which characterizes the  gassurface interaction and which itself is a  function of  the  bulk  concentration (c,)  and the  defect concentration  immediately  beneath  the  surface  (cg). As derived  in  the  text, in  the  case  of  an enhancement  effect, the  extra  conductivity in  a  measurement  parallel to  the  interface is found to  be  (pure  material)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Nk,, is  the  characteristic exponent in  the  first layer  adjacent  to  the  proper  surface. In the  case  of a depletion  effect, the  extra  resistance (in  a measurement  perpendicular  to the boundary) is approximately

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

if the  equilibrium with  the  bulk  is not  established, and

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

if  overall equilibrium  is  achieved.  If  the  measurement  of the  depletion  effect is  performed parallel to  the  interface the  extra  conductivity can be  expressed  as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

if only  boundary  equilibrium is established, and

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

if  also  bulk equilibrium  is  established. Eq. 81 to Eq. 83 are  only valid  for  a simple  defect chemistry  where only k determines  the  electrically dominating effect. Due  to  profile effects (anisotropy), the  parameters  (x, 8,  y, S,  E, &lt;,  n are  not  necessarily related in  a  simple  manner to  each  other  (see text).
