Electrochemical methods for  the  determination of  transference numbers in polymer  electrolytes are considered and  a  new technique which  overcomes some of  the problems  associated with  other methods  in current use  is  described. Results are  given  of  measurements  of  the  transference numbers  of  lithium and trifluoromethanesulphonate ions in  poly(ethylene oxide) at 90°C.  A mean value of 0.46\_ 0.02 is reported for lithium.

## INTRODUCTION

Polymer electrolytes are defined  as ionic  conductors formed by dissolving salts in suitable high-molecularweight  polymers, such as the  polyethers, poly(ethylene oxide) or  poly(propylene  oxide) 1'2. True  polymer electrolytes contain no  low-molecular-weight solvent and have  ionic conductivity which  is  related to  the  segmental motion in  amorphous regions of  the  polymer  host.  In recent  years  there  have been numerous studies of  the electrical characteristics of  such  phases, including measurements  of  the  conductivity as  a function of  salt concentration, host molecular weight, temperature, pressure and the  frequency of  the  electrical perturbation. Theoretical models  for the  conductivity mechanism have been proposed 3.  Despite  this  activity it  is  still unclear what actual species are  involved in  carrying the  electric charge; it has  even  proved  difficult toestablish reliably the fractions of current  carried  by cationic and  anionic constituents. Electrochemical methods  and  measurements  of diffusion coefficients (e.g.  by  pulsed field gradient n.m.r,  techniques) have been used to try  to answer this question. However, it  has been suggested 2 that under certain  conditions---such as  where  the electrolyte contains  a significant concentration of  ion pairs--these two techniques may  provide  information that is not directly comparable.  In this  paper the electrochemical methods  so  far used  to determine transference numbers in  polymer  electrolytes are  briefly reviewed, and a new method is  described in  detail which gives reproducible and  reliable values even at low temperatures where other  techniques  are difficult to apply.

For an electrolyte which dissociates to  give  a single cationic  and  anionic  species, the electric transport number,  t+ say, is  defined as  the  number of  faradays of charge  carried by the  cations across  a reference plane (fixed relative to  the  solvent) when a total of  one  faraday

where  i+  and  i\_  are the  partial currents carried by  cations and anions  respectively, and i  is the  total current. While such  a  definition can  be  generalized to  cover the  situation where  complex  ions exist, it is not  of any  practical value in situations where there  is  a  fast  dynamic equilibrium between  the  complex  ions  and their constituents.

Consider  a salt M÷Adissolved in  a polymer  host  of low relative permittivity. Then a series of  equilibria are likely to  exist in  which  associated species are  formed, e.g.:

Thus the  cation  constituent M is  carried towards  the cathode  by M  +,  M2A  +,  M3A  2÷  ..... and towards  the anode by A-, MA  2  .... The only  quantity that  can be measured experimentally is  the  difference between the fluxes  of M-containing  species  directed  towards the cathode  and anode,  i.e. the  net  number of  moles of  M being transferred in one direction. The  transference number T÷ is  defined as  the net number of  faradays of charge  carried across  the  reference plane  by the  cation constituent in  the  direction of  the  cathode, during  the passage  of  one  faraday of  charge  across the  plane 4.

In conventional electrolyte solutions, experimental techniques such  as  the  moving-boundary  method have been  developed to  allow  almost  routine determination of transference numbers with  great accuracy. For  polymer electrolytes these  standard techniques are  either inapplicable or  usable only  with  great difficulty, so  that a

number of  alternative m thods  have  been  studiedS1 o. So far no method has  become well  established and there is considerable disagreement over  the  values of  transference numbers so  far  reported. The Tubandt  method  11 is  the technique most  commonly applied to  conventional solid electrolytes. It  is  directly based  on Faraday's laws  and requires weight  variations in  the  electrolyte regions near the  two  cell electrodes, caused  by  the  passage of  a  known amount of  charge, to  be  measured. It is difficult toapply this method  to  polymer  systems because of  the requirement to  maintain the  electrolyte asa  series of  nonadherent thin sections. Cheradame and  coworkers 5  were able  to  carry out  this experiment for  highly crosslinked networks where  the  electrolyte could  readily be  separated into its component sections after the  passage of  current. Armand et al. 8 developed  a technique  based on the measurement  of  the  e.m.f, of  a  concentration cell formed by  contacting two  previously thermally equilibrated halfcells. This  method  is  experimentally difficult and  has  the disadvantage of  requiring knowledge  of  the  variation of salt  activity with concentration. Perhaps the most popular  technique  for  transference number  measurements  in  polymer  electrolytes i that developed  first by S~rensen  and Jacobsen 7 using  an analysis of  the  a.c. impedance of a cell  with two  electrodes, each nonblocking with  respect to  the  cation. The method  is based on the  theory for  the  response of  such  a  cell to  a smallsignal  a.c.  perturbation developed  by  MacDonald 12. Here it  was shown that at  low frequencies the  current flowing through  such  a cell is  affected by concentration gradients near the electrodes which gave rise  to a characteristic feature due to  a diffusional impedance  in the  complex  plane. One of  the problems  of  this technique is  that it can  be applied to  polymer  electrolytes only  at very  high  temperatures since in  general the  frequencies required to  show  the diffusional part of  the impedance  are too  low to  be of  practical use.  There  have  been  further criticisms 13  of  this method  when used  for certain lithiumbased  polymer  electrolytes, where interpretation f the complex  impedance  plot becomes uncertain.

## STEADY-STATE CURRENTS

If a cell of  the  form

## M[ MX-polymer host  [ M

is  polarized by the application of a  small,  constant potential difference between the  electrodes, the  initial current, the  value of  which  is determined in  the absence of electrode  ffects by the  conductivity of  the  electrolyte, is found to fall with time until a  steady-state value  is eventually observed.  In the  simplest case,  this  fall in current is  due to  the  establishment of  a concentration gradient across the  cell which  is  responsible for

- (i)  reducing and  finally stopping net  motion  of  anionic species,
- (ii) generating an e.m.f, which acts  in the  opposite direction to the applied  field and  thus reduces  the migration current of  cations and anions, and
- (iii) increasing the motion of the cations  in the direction of  the  field to  compensate  for  the  reduction in the  migration current.

The behaviour of  such  cells has  been  analysed in  detail by Bruce  and  Vincent 14,  who showed that under  defined circumstances,

where I  s and I  ° are the steady-state and initial cell currents respectively. This relationship is  only  strictly valid for ideal electrolytes in  simple cells where  there is no convection  and  where  the polarization voltage  is vanishingly small. In  practice it  was demonstrated that useful information can  be obtained for  real electrolytes, and that  the error  introduced by using  polarization voltages of up  to  10  mV  was  acceptable. It was  also shown that equation (5) was invalid where  the  electrode kinetics were not  gast, or  when resistive layers were present on the  electrode surfaces.

The steady-state current method has been used by Blonsky et al. 9 to determine  transference numbers in poly(alkoxyphosphasene) polymer  electrolytes based  on silver and zinc  trifluoromethanesulphonate and for  a range  of  lithium and  sodium  salts in  poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(ethylene succinate) 15.  It  is  not  clear whether these  workers  made any allowance for  electrode effects which may significantly affect the  potential distribution and  the current  flowing in  such cells  and  hence significantly affect the  determination of  the  transference number.

We  now describe a technique in  which  a  combination of  d.c. and  a.c. electrical polarizations are  used  to  enable transference numbers  of polymer electrolytes to be determined in  a  straightforward manner, even  in circumstances where  the  diffusion coefficients of  the  ionic species are low  or  where  precise correction for passivating layers or  slow  electrode kinetics are  required.

## EXP ERI  MENTAL

All operations  were  carried  out in an  argon-filled glovebox  with  water  content lower  than  2  ppm.

Polymer  electrolyte was prepared  from  poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) of  average molecular weight  4  x 106  (BDH Ltd)  and lithium trifluoromethanesulphonate (3M  UK Ltd)  to  give  a -CH2CH2  O- to  lithium ratio of  9:1. The solvent-free method previously described ~6'17  was used to  produce  13.0  mm  diameter electrolyte discs of  uniform thickness between 150 and 200  pm.

Lithium  electrodes 10.7 mm  in  diameter were  punched from ribbon (Alfa  Products), and LiIPEOLiCF3SO 3 (9:l) lLi cells were assembled  in  the  holder shown in Figure la (an  expanded view of  the  central section, not  to scale, is  shown in Figure Ib). The cell assembly was  sealed  in a  glass  tube with tungsten breakthrough contacts and a NiCr/NiAl  thermocouple which  was located close to  the  electrolyte. The tube  was placed  in  a miniature oven (Buchi  TO-50) which was thermostatted to  90  + 0.5°C.

Electrochemical measurements  were  performed using a Solai;ron  1286  interfaced to a  frequency  response analyser (Solartron 1250)  under  the control of a  dedicated microcomputer  (Hewlett-Packard 9000/216).

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Cells  were first equilibrated for  3  h  at  90°C  prior  to measurement  of  the  complex  impedance  as  a function of frequency from 1  Hz  to  65  kHz using  an a.c. signal of

10  mV  peak-to-peak. The results, when plotted on the complex plane (Figure 2), were consistent with the equivalent circuit shown,  where  R1 and  C1 are  associated with passivating films  formed on  the electrode (first reported  by  Fauteux13),  and R 2 corresponds  to the resistance of  the  electrolyte. A d.c. bias  of  10.0  mV  was now  applied  to the  cell, and the response  of  the  celt current was  monitored with  respect to  time  until a  steadystate current was reached (Figure  3). In a number of experiments the  a.c. impedance  was monitored at  various times during the course  of the d.c.  polarization by applying the  a.c. perturbation on  top  of the  d.c. level. The a.c. impedance  was measured  in  all experiments when the steady-state current had been  reached.

The cells were  now left at  open  circuit for  80-110  h to permit  the  concentration gradients to  disperse, prior to the  polarization procedures being  repeated to test the method further.

The  fall in  current from  t = 0  until the  steady-state value was reached  is  considered to  result from  two processes:

(i)  the growth  at  the  electrodes of  passivating layers to a limiting thickness (which occurs  whether or not a current is  flowing), and

(ii) the establishment of a  concentration gradient in  the electrolyte which  affects the  motion  of  the  ions.

With  the lithium  trifluoromethanesulphonate electrolyte the  passivating layers were found  to  increase in resistance over  the  first 24  h after the  cell was assembled and  raised to  90°C.  The  effect of the growth  of these layers was  seen when  the a.c.  impedance was  monitored intermittently during  the  d.c.  polarization (Fioure 4). After about  30  h no further significant change  with  time was found  for the  a.c. impedance.

Bruce  and  Vincent x4  showed  that for small amounts  of polarization, and neglecting  ion-ion electrostatic interactions, the initial and  steady-state currents are given respectively by

initial and steady-state resistances of the passivating layers, and I  ° and P  are  the  initial and steady-state currents. From equation (6)

The results of  six  polarization experiments using  three different cells are  given  in Table I. The value  of  T÷ was found  to  be  0.46-t-0.02. Results from  subsequent polarizations of  the  same cell had a deviation of  0.01  or less.

A number of  points may be made. First, equating T÷ with I°/P gives rise to  a  very  large and  variable error----a value  of  0.61  was calculated in  one case. Secondly, the method  is quite general and  may be  applied in  situations where  the  electrodes behave  differently. For  example  with LiCIOa-based  electrolytes we have  found  that the  small impedance  associated with  a rather different passivating layer shows  a  decrease in  resistance as  current is  passed. Finally, provided that the  passivating layer has  been  fully established, as  in  our  second  polarization experiments, a steady-state current  can be established in under 12  h (Figure 5). It  must be emphasized, however,  that  even

before polarization with  a small  d.c. bias, and after a steady-state current has  been  reached, it is  possible to make allowance  for  electrode effects and hence  make reproducible measurements of the transference number  of the polymer  electrolyte. The  method  has been  tested with a 9:1  PEO-LiCFaSO 3  electrolyte at  90°C,  where  T+ was found  to  be 0.46 \_+0.02. Further measurements  will be reportcxi in which transference numbers have been measured for other  electrolytes and  under various conditions. We  are  also currently engaged  in  a study of transference number as  a  function of  concentration in  a completely amorphous  polymer  electrolyte system.
